TUYN01Design of Plasma-Based CollidersThis presentation covers the design of plasma and wakefield-based particle colliders. It will briefly review the development of wakefield collider concepts over the past decades and then focus on the HALHF Higgs Factory and 10 TeV pCM Wakefield Collider design studies, discuss commonalities between these efforts and highlight their unique aspects.J.
