THAN01AI-driven neutrino diagnostics and radiation-hard beam instrumentation for next-generation neutrino experiments900The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deliver a high-intensity, multi-megawatt neutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), enabling precision tests of the three-neutrino paradigm, CP violation searches, neutrino mass ordering determination, and supernova neutrino studies. To accelerate DUNE’s physics reach and ensure robust beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. At its core is a Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor using a physics-informed Digital Twin. By reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be reduced from 5% to 1%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US–Japan R&D effort will deploy a LAPPD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. ToF measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects. Simulations confirm strong response to these effects. ML models predict beam quality and horn current to sub-percent accuracy from muon data, enhancing anomaly detection and stability. This scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity, reduces systematics, and sets a new standard for high-power accelerator operations.S.

THAN02Fermilab Booster beam loss modelling and rebalancing using Bayesian methods906To meet PIP-II upgrade requirements, Fermilab Booster losses need to be reduced by 50\% compared to present levels. So far, simulations are not good enough to predict loss patterns. Thus, an extensive Booster tune up will be necessary to achieve required performance. In this paper we present an effort to build a data-driven loss model using Bayesian techniques, and subsequently to rebalance losses for higher trip margins. We first created several sets of spatially and temporally isolated orbit and optics knobs, and trained Gaussian process models for each beam loss monitor as well as beam current. Novel techniques of uncertainty constraints and approximate GP fitting were introduced to handle safety and timing requirements. We then performed single and multi-objective tuning using scalarized objectives comprised of critical beam loss locations. We achieved significant rebalancing of losses, increasing margins by 25%, as well as an overall improvement in transmission efficiency of 0.4%. Automated data collection is being developed so that more accurate surrogate models can be trained over time.N. Kuklev, J. Eldred, M.

THAN03Ultrafast THz detection and enhanced Electro-Optical timing for longitudinal beam diagnostics at Free Electron Lasers910This work presents advancements in precision longitudinal beam diagnostics for Free Electron Lasers (FELs), integrating zero-bias Schottky-diode-based THz detectors and upgraded electro-optical bunch arrival-time monitors (EO-BAMs) for low-charge operation. The developed THz detector achieves ps-scale response times and 70 GHz intermediate-frequency bandwidth, enabling single-shot THz detection across kHz–MHz repetition rates. Characterized from DC to 5.56 THz$^{*}$, it can serve as a critical tool for bunch compression monitoring$^{**}$ and lays the groundwork for future development ultra-broadband THz spectrometers. Concurrently, a novel printed circuit board (PCB) pickup structure enhances EO-BAM performance, preliminary results gave a slew rate of 275.7 mV/ps $\pm$ 34.6 mV/ps for a peak-to-peak voltage of 4.16 V $\pm$ 0.31 V at 3.45 pC after de-embedding$^{***}$. Optimized PCB materials and planar designs improve signal integrity, achieving a simulated jitter-charge product of 9 fs·pC$^{****}$. This upgrade enables reliable operation at 1 pC for XFELs and ultrafast diffraction facilities while enhancing timing resolution in standard modes. The PCB architecture enables unprecedented flexibility for future multi-functional diagnostics. These innovations address critical challenges in low-charge, high-repetition-rate FEL diagnostics, advancing real-time beam characterization and accelerator optimization.A. Penirschke, B.
