TUZD01High-Power Targetry R&D road map for HEPDesigning a reliable target is already a challenge for MW-class facilities today and has led several major accelerator facilities to operate at lower power due to target concerns. With present plans to increase beam power for next-generation accelerator facilities in the next decade, timely R&D in support of robust high-power targets is critical to secure the full physics benefits of ambitious accelerator power upgrades. The next generation of high-power targets and beam-intercepting devices (beam dumps, absorbers, collimators…) will have more complex geometries, novel materials, and new concepts that allow for use of improved high-heat-flux cooling methods. Advanced numerical simulations need to be developed to support design of reliable high-power beam targets. In parallel, development of radiation-hardened beam instrumentation is needed. Irradiation methods for high-power targets must be further developed, and new irradiation facilities are needed since only a few facilities worldwide offer beams suitable for target testing. A comprehensive R&D program must be implemented to address the many complex challenges faced by multi-MW beam intercepting devices.F. Pellemoine, S.
