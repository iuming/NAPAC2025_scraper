THTD01RF Sources for Accelerator ApplicationsThis tutorial will begin with a brief historical account and review of technological developments and innovations in radio frequency (RF) systems for particle accelerators. After an introduction, we will provide more in-depth review of technological developments of RF sources for particle accelerators and will provide some perspectives on the state-of-the art RF sources tailored designed for a variety of particle accelerators applications.A.
