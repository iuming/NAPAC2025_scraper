WEP - Wednesday Poster Session,WEP005,"A compact top-off injection with cascaded nonlinear Kickers for diffraction limited storage rings690To address the intrinsic dynamic aperture (DA) limitations of fourth-generation diffraction-limited synchrotron light source, we investigate a novel injection scheme utilizing multiple nonlinear kickers (NLKs) with optimized hardware design and phase advances in the storage ring (SR). Positioning the NLKs near the injection point reduces beam perturbation, while their on-axis zero field and gradient enable transparent injection—suppressing orbit and beam-shape oscillations during top-off operations. Particle-tracking simulations were performed using Accelerator Toolbox (AT), alongside the development of automated tools for converting magnetic field maps into AT-compatible kick maps, inserting NLKs at arbitrary lattice locations, conducting tracking, and optimizing NLK configurations. A key challenge is to shift the off-axis magnetic field peak closer to the beam orbit. Our novel NLK design achieves a peak within 5 mm of the axis—a significant improvement over the conventional greater than 7 mm range. Simulations accounting for realistic alignment and magnetic field errors indicate that a relaxed 5 mm DA and injection efficiency > 90% could be feasible for the NSLS-II upgrade lattice.",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP005.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP005,
WEP - Wednesday Poster Session,WEP006,"Application of low-cost sensors and deep autoencoders for monitoring water pumps in particle accelerators694In particle accelerator facilities, cooling-water pumps play a critical role in removing substantial amounts (in megawatts) of waste heat from numerous high-power accelerator components (e.g., magnets, radio frequency structures, power supplies) and beamline components*. Despite their role in daily operations, inspecting hundreds of water pumps is labor-intensive and performed only occasionally. Their unexpected failures can potentially lead to degradation of beam quality, hardware damage, and costly unplanned downtime**. This study introduces an innovative method for real-time monitoring of water pump vibrations to identify anomalies that signal potential mechanical failures. Our approach integrates (i) low-cost vibration sensors, which will consistently sample pump vibration data and transmit it to a (ii) Deep Autoencoder*** model for detecting anomalies. The autoencoder model recognizes each pump's normal pump vibration patterns and identifies subtle deviations. This monitoring framework can facilitate proactive maintenance by enabling early detection of anomalies, enhancing pump reliability, lowering maintenance expenses, and minimizing costly downtimes.",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP006.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP006,

The buncher modulates the input direct-current beam into 5.7-GHz bunch train. The buncher consists of two radiofrequency (RF) cavities. Immediately downstream of each RF cavity, there is an electrostatic potential depression (EPD) section. An EPD section in an electrically insulated beam pipe biased with a negative high voltage. The EPD method remarkably shortens the buncher structure by rapidly forming the bunch train. Each of the RF cavities and the EPD sections uses an individual set of rectangular permanent magnets, arranged in a circular array, which provide a solenoid-like focusing field. The polarity of the magnets is configured to form an alternating on-axis magnetic field orientation for minimizing the total weight.

Recent experimental evidence shows that this limitation can be mitigated by reducing the RF pulse length to a few nanoseconds. One key challenge in designing an accelerator operating in the short-pulse regime is achieving the required short filling time. In this work, we designed a novel waveguide power splitter to independently feed an array of accelerating cells. A prototype X-band waveguide array for a one-to-four power splitter has been developed to drive standing-wave cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. The power is designed to be equally split and fed into four cavities, with the desired phase advance per cavity. A 3D-printed prototype has been used for low-power microwave measurements (""cold"" tests).

WEP - Wednesday Poster Session,WEP020,"Design of a low-power proof-of-concept multi-stage amplifier test stand to model and implement outphasing control for the LANSCE 805 MHz solid-state high-power RF amplifier725Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) has a project to investigate the feasibility for a replacement radio-frequency (RF) amplifier that is not reliant on vacuum electron tubes, has a similar footprint, and equivalent RF functionality. Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) will be used in combined configuration. To maintain existing operational capabilities with these GaN amplifiers, the low-level control system needs to be modified for maximum transistor lifetime. The HEMT operates in a saturated condition, with a constant amplitude drive signal to avoid the high-power dissipation of linear operation with reduced drive. This leaves the phase of the RF inputs as a control mechanism, utilizing outphasing for amplitude modulation of the multistage amplifier. The GaN amplifiers also require a bias sequencing/protection board that is being designed and tested separately. To test and verify the control system, a low power test rack using commercial wideband RF components was built. This model system includes drive control, four 10 W amplifier stages, a final combination chassis, and accelerator timing system.

WEP - Wednesday Poster Session,WEP021,"Design of an optical amplifier for amplified OSC in IOTA facility at Fermilab729Optical stochastic cooling (OSC) is a cutting-edge beam cooling technology to reduce, control the 3 dimensional spread and the motion of particle beams. It has recently been successfully, experimentally, demonstrated in Fermilab's IOTA storage ring, marking a major step forward in beam cooling. OSC has the potential to significantly improve both the performance and flexibility as a beam cooling system. One promising way to boost OSC performance is by adding a high-gain optical amplifier. However, this amplifier must be carefully designed to meet the specific constraints of the OSC system. A major challenge lies in the limited optical delay, which is just 6 mm for the case of IOTA, set by the beam bypass, restricts us to use a short-length gain medium. This, along with IOTA’s high repetition rate and the relatively long duration of the optical pulses, limits the peak power available for the pump laser without damaging the crystal, which is crucial for achieving strong nonlinear gain. Additionally, it's essential to preserve the phase coherence of the undulator radiation during amplification, which further complicates the amplifier design. This report details a specialized amplifier setup that addresses these challenges, includes simulations of the integrated system, and summarizes the latest experimental progress and results.",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP021.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP021,

WEP - Wednesday Poster Session,WEP057,"Low frequency ripple current attenuation for slow corrector power supplies in the APS Upgrade792As part of the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U), approximately one thousand bipolar power supplies were installed to power the slow corrector magnets. During the APS-U commissioning, a 1Hz harmonic was detected in the beam motion. This harmonic originates from the 480V AC grid, caused by the booster ramping power supply operating at 1 Hz. The resulting grid disturbance introduced low-frequency ripples into both the corrector magnet power supplies and the L-Bend M1/M2 supplies, leading to the observed 1 Hz beam motion. This paper proposes two methods to mitigate these ripples in the corrector supplies: setpoint compensation using repetitive control, and regulation circuit adjustments through a simple jumper reconfiguration. The second approach was adopted and applied to all slow corrector magnet power supplies. Operational data showed that the low-frequency ripples were significantly attenuated in the corrector supplies, and in combination with fine-tuning of the L-Bend M1/M2 supplies, the 1 Hz beam motion was successfully eliminated.",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP057.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP057,

AWA’s electron beam is optimized for producing large wakefields in resonant structures to study structure wakefield acceleration. This is achieved by maximizing total beam charge, and by correct bunch train timing to enhance the wakefield via inter-bunch coherence. The properties of the bunch train are determined by a “multisplitter” in the photoinjector laser system, in which a series of beamsplitters splits one laser source into eight - ideally equal - pulses. However, AWA’s previous system did not split pulses evenly, with up to a 2:1 ratio between pulse energies within a train. Damaging electrical breakdown events within the electron gun, driven by high single bunch charge, occurred at lower total charge in this non-uniform set-up, limiting maximum charge. Thus, a new multisplitter using polarizing beamsplitters and half-wave plates (HWPs) was implemented. Unlike the previous fixed-ratio beam-splitter design, the new system enables tuning the splitting ratio for each beamsplitter, resulting in a more uniform pulse train.

The existing damper uses an inductive coupling loop to extract RF energy from the cavity which then goes through a filter in order to reflect the fundamental frequency back into the cavity while passing HOMs to a dump load. The new damper intends to replace the filter portion of the system with a wider band variant while also changing the topology from a coaxial cable loop filter to a componentized PCB-based design. Primary design challenges include bandwidth coverage, impedance matching of the various modes, long term thermal and mechanical stability, radiation hardness, and high voltage handling. Initial designs achieved the desired damping but were found to quickly succumb to destructive arcing due to the voltages present. More finalized designs intend to address this problem through circuit design modifications as well as the use of hardier components.",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP101.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP101,
