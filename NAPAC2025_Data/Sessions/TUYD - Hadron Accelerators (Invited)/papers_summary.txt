   Title: Laser Assisted Charge Exchange injection at the Spallation Neutron Source298Laser Assisted Charge Exchange (LACE) technology is being developed to replace foil-based charge exchange injection in high power H- accelerators. The possibility of replacing the foil with field-stripping will greatly reduce injection losses, and therefore is a promising technology for future high-intensity multi-megawatt power H- beams. The technique of LACE has been demonstrated but not in a configuration that allows injection of beam into a ring. This talk will present recent progress on design of a demonstrator at SNS that will allow injection into the SNS ring. The committee also hopes that this talk will review previous experimental results from LACE feasibility studies.
