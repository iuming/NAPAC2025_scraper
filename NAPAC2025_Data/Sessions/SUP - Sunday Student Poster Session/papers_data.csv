SUP - Sunday Student Poster Session,SUP001,Preliminary study of space charge and beam-beam interplay in a collider ring,H. Alamprese,"Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, Michigan State University; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Michigan State University","Hadron Collider Rings offer unprecedented opportunities to address fundamental scientific questions in particle and nuclear physics. To achieve these ambitious goals, the colliders must deliver exceptionally high levels of luminosity, hence require high intensity hadron beam in the ring, which leads to high beam-beam parameter, as well as comparable space charge effects. This study focuses on nonlinear effects that impact the beam dynamics within the hadron accelerator ring, including weak-strong beam-beam interactions and their interplay with space charge effects. Accurately predicting these non-linearities, particularly resonances arising during multi-turn acceleration, is critical for long beam lifetime and optimal accelerator performance. This work presents an initial attempt to develop an optimized approach that integrates space charge effects across the entire ring length while incorporating localized beam-beam interactions at specific interaction points.",,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/TUP080.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-TUP080,

Resonant interactions between photons and atomic systems offer significantly enhanced resonant cross-sections, often several orders of magnitude greater than what is achievable through conventional Compton scattering of electron and photon beams. The Gamma Factory initiative at CERN aims to exploit this enhancement by employing ultra-relativistic, partially stripped ion beams to generate high-intensity gamma-ray beams. In this work, we first examine the energy-matching requirements for resonance. We then present a semi-classical model based on a damped-driven oscillator to describe resonant Compton scattering.

Mondal,Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,"Optical stochastic cooling (OSC) is a cutting-edge beam cooling technology to reduce, control the 3 dimensional spread and the motion of particle beams. It has recently been successfully, experimentally, demonstrated in Fermilab's IOTA storage ring, marking a major step forward in beam cooling. OSC has the potential to significantly improve both the performance and flexibility as a beam cooling system. One promising way to boost OSC performance is by adding a high-gain optical amplifier. However, this amplifier must be carefully designed to meet the specific constraints of the OSC system. A major challenge lies in the limited optical delay, which is just 6 mm for the case of IOTA, set by the beam bypass, restricts us to use a short-length gain medium. This, along with IOTA’s high repetition rate and the relatively long duration of the optical pulses, limits the peak power available for the pump laser without damaging the crystal, which is crucial for achieving strong nonlinear gain. Additionally, it's essential to preserve the phase coherence of the undulator radiation during amplification, which further complicates the amplifier design.

These are computationally expensive due to the need to solve the equations of motion for large numbers of charged particles in prescribed and self-consistent fields. We introduce a method that significantly reduces the computational burden by constructing approximate invariant densities via a two-step transfer operator approach. The method gives practical approximations to phase-space level curves, capturing essential dynamics without extensive particle pushing. Prior work has shown how to find such curves via kernel-based level set learning*. Our method is fast, avoids kernel tuning, and integrates with existing codes, enabling rapid assessment of figures of merit in constrained optimization algorithms such as Adjoint with a Chaser, AWC**.

Using Reinforcement Learning (and other potential ML methods), the trained surrogate acts as the “environment” in which a simple ML control agent could learn to dynamically adjust the quadrupole ramp at 430 break points within the 43 microsecond spill window.

A Nb₃Sn coating technique has been developed for Nb SRF cavities using co-sputtering of Nb-Sn composite target in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system. The composite target configuration and discharge conditions for co-sputtering were optimized to deposit Nb-Sn films on flat Nb substrates, followed by annealing to form Nb₃Sn. Multiple strategies have been explored to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb₃Sn coating, including optimizing a two-step annealing process, annealing in Sn vapor, and a light Sn recoating process.

Accelerometer data from ground transportation of previous projects at Jefferson Lab provides the baseline for the expected frequency and magnitude of vibrational and shock events during transit.

Laurel,Los Alamos National Laboratory,"The following work will detail the development and implementation of a system which will measure the voltage and current from two points on a high-voltage switch called a thyratron and automatically manipulate two variable transformers controlling these values. Each of the extraction kickers at LANSCE (SRFK71 & SRFK81) uses a thyratron to trigger their respective pulses. The thyratrons have separate heaters for the cathode and reservoir, and each needs to maintain specific voltage and current levels for the thyratron to work properly. Currently, the method of measuring and adjusting these values requires locking out the system, opening the tank, and measuring the voltage and current of each heater, then adjusting two variable transformers by hand to reach the desired values. This controller consists of four analog-to-digital converters which will relay these measurements out of the modulator as digital signals through fiber optic transceivers.

Ahmed,"Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Old Dominion University","Design of radio frequency (RF) couplers and diagnostics require a good understanding of the electromagnetic mode patterns of RF cavities. This study investigates the adiabatic transformation of transverse magnetic (TM) modes in a cylindrical cavity into transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes of a coaxial cavity by gradually introducing an inner conductor. Using CST Studio Suite, we simulate the eigenmode evolution as the geometry transforms from a pure cylindrical to a coaxial configuration. We track the behavior of TM010 through TM014 modes to observe the continuous evolution into the corresponding TEM0 through TEM4 modes of the coaxial cavity. The process is governed by the evolution of the electric field orientation as the geometry shifts, enabling the axial TM fields to reorient into the radial electric field configuration of TEM modes. Field patterns, eigen-frequencies, and mode indentities are analyzed throughtout the transition. The results provide simulation-based evidence that TM to TEM conversion occurs without generation of newer eigenmodes, offering a valuable insight into the design of transition regions in superconducting RF (SRF) systems and provides a foundation for experimental validation.",,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEP062.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEP062,

Mengel,"Beam Alpha Incorporated; Hbar Technologies, LLC","Beam Alpha developed a kilowatt-scale fusion microreactor that directly converts nuclear energy to electrical energy without intermediate heat steps. This device has an output of 1.6 million volts DC. A converter is needed to transform this potential energy into useful electrical power. To achieve this the ""Pulsed Ion Reflex Klystron"" has been developed. The PIRK aims to achieve high conversion efficiencies by directing negatively charged ions through a re-entrant resonant cavity hundreds of times to gradually transfer energy from the moving particles to said cavity. Ions will be released into a 6-meter linear accelerator with roughly 1000 precisely spaced electrodes forming a quasi-parabolic potential. This potential is symmetric about the midpoint of the tube causing ions to oscillate with a frequency of approximately 1 MHz independent of energy. Perturbations to this parabolic potential are designed to provide radial electrostatic beam focusing. An algorithm is devised to produce optimal voltage curves to maximize both longitudinal bunching and radial confinement, and these curves are examined against practically realizable potentials. Energy is coupled out of the resonant cavity using a loop antenna connected to a silicon carbide rectifying diode.

However, the exact mechanisms by which these treatments improve cavity performance remain largely unknown. This work provides new insights into the role of nitrogen and oxygen in SRF cavity performance by using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to precisely quantify the concentrations and depth profiles of these impurities within niobium cutouts. We correlate these impurity profiles with detailed cavity performance measurements, including surface resistance and quality factor, and compare our findings with predictions from BCS theory. The results demonstrate that while both nitrogen and oxygen enhance performance, ten times more oxygen is required to achieve the same reduction in BCS resistance as interstitial nitrogen.
