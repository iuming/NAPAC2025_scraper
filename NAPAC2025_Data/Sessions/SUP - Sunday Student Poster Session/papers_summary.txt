   Abstract: Beam Alpha developed a kilowatt-scale fusion microreactor that directly converts nuclear energy to electrical energy without intermediate heat steps. This device has an output of 1.6 million volts DC. A converter is needed to transform this potential energy into useful electrical power. To achieve t...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-THYN01
   Abstract: Nitrogen and oxygen-based surface treatments have revolutionized the performance of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities, enabling them to reach higher gradients and lower losses. However, the exact mechanisms by which these treatments improve cavity performance remain largely unknown. This...

   Abstract: In order to reach the nearest star Proxima Centauri within a century, a distance of 4.224 light-years from our solar system, the average spacecraft velocity needs to be 4.2% of the speed of light. Therefore, according to the rocket equation, the weighted average exhaust velocity needs to be over 1% ...
