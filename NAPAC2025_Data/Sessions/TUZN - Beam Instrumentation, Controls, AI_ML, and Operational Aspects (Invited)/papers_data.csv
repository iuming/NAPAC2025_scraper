"TUZN - Beam Instrumentation, Controls, AI/ML, and Operational Aspects (Invited)",TUZN01,"High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography321Inferring 4D or 6D phase space distributions from 1D or 2D measurements is a challenging inverse problem encountered in particle accelerators. Entropy maximization (ME) is an established method to incorporate prior information in under-constrained problems but is typically infeasible in high-dimensional spaces. In this talk, I discuss two approaches to high-dimensional M",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/TUZN01.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-TUZN01,
