WEXN - Accelerator Technology and Sustainability (Invited),WEXN01,"Accelerator workforce development625Accelerator science has been hugely influential on research, contributing to physics Nobel Prize-winning research every three years. The DOE Office of Science invests in accelerator science to sustain America’s excellence and constructs and operates large-scale scientific user facilities to be vital tools of discovery. Developing the next breakthroughs in accelerator science, and designing, building, and operating user facilities, requires a large, highly skilled workforce of accelerator scientists, engineers, and technical (AS&E) staff. Some portions of the AS&E workforce are best planned with a long-term, national perspective in mind. A roundtable meeting was called with participants comprising 9 DOE National Laboratories and the Office of Science Nuclear Physics User Facility FRI",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/WEXN01.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-WEXN01,
