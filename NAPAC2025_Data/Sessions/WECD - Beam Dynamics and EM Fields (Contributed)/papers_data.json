      "title": "Simulations of IBS through electric field fluctuations668We present a study of intra-beam scattering (IBS) in high-brightness electron beams, incorporating a recent theory that accounts for enhanced temporal correlations of electric field fluctuations. These correlations, absent in conventional binary-collision models, arise from the periodic betatron motion of particles within the beam. To enable direct verification of the theoretical calculations, we perform simulations in a computer code specifically written for that purpose. In the code, the particle distribution is preserved over time, ensuring conditions compatible with theoretical assumptions, and the IBS is neatly separated from the conventional Space Charge (SC) effect. The simulations, benchmarked against an exactly solvable case of an infinite isotropic uniform plasma, show good agreement with both uncorrelated models, such as Piwinski’s, and the new correlation-based theory, across various bunch distributions and dynamical regimes. This validates the simulation approach and highlights the role of time-correlated fields in accurate IBS modeling.",

      "title": "Single-bunch instabilities at the Fermilab Recycler Ring676Understanding and characterizing collective instabilities is critical for high-intensity operation at the Fermilab Recycler Ring. This work presents an application of the the Nested Head-Tail (NHT) formalism for modeling single-bunch transverse instabilities, incorporating analytical solutions to the resistive wall and theta wake impedances in the absence of space charge. Predicted growth rates and mode structures are benchmarked against PyHEADTAIL simulations and ongoing experimental measurements. The experimental program includes studies of both bare-machine instabilities and beam behavior under transverse feedback (the Waker experiment), providing a comprehensive validation of the theoretical model. These results support the interpretation of Waker data and contribute to the development of predictive tools for beam stability in future high-intensity configurations.",
