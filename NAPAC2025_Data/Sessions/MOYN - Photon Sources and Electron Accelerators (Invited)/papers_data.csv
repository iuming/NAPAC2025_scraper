MOYN - Photon Sources and Electron Accelerators (Invited),MOYN01,"Operation of the APS-U injectors with high single bunch charge20The APS-Upgrade uses swap-out injection, which means the injectors must supply a full charge bunch (up to 16 nC) to replace a depleted one in the storage ring. The APS injector chain consists of a linac, particle accumulator ring (PAR), and booster synchrotron. These machines were kept in place for the APS-U, with several key upgrades to support high charge operation. Major upgrades include a new timing system, improved diagnostics, and a new amplifier for bunch compression in the PA",,,,,False,https://meow.elettra.eu/97/pdf/MOYN01.pdf,True,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-MOYN01,

MOYN - Photon Sources and Electron Accelerators (Invited),HEPS26,"The High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is the first 4th generation light source and the first high-energy storage ring light source in China, with a beam energy of 6 GeV, a circumference of 1360 m and a natural emittance of a few tens of picometers. As a green-field light source, the HEPS construction started in 2019 and is scheduled to be completed in 2025. Now civil construction, component fabrication and tunnel installation, and beam commissioning of the HEPS has been basically finished. In this report, the accelerator and especially the storage ring commissioning results, and main physics issues faced and corresponding measures during the beam commissioning will be presented.",,,,,False,,False,,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-NAPAC2025-HEPS26,
