   Title: High brightness electron injectorsHigh-brightness electron injectors are foundational to the performance of modern particle accelerators, enabling applications from X-ray free-electron lasers to ultrafast electron diffraction and advanced accelerator concepts. This tutorial will provide an overview of the physics and design principles underlying high-brightness injectors, including photocathode radiofrequency (RF) guns, beam emittance preservation, space-charge effects, and brightness optimization strategies. We will review state-of-the-art injector technologies, diagnostic techniques, and recent advances in cathode materials and RF structures. The tutorial is aimed at graduate students, early-career researchers, and accelerator professionals seeking a deeper understanding of injector systems and their role in driving next-generation accelerator performance.
