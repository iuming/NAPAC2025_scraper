      "title": "APS upgrade: Commissioning the world’s first light source based on swap-out injection1The Advanced Photon Source (APS) has recently completed a major upgrade, replacing its 25-year-old storage ring with a cutting-edge hybrid seven-bend achromat lattice enhanced by six additional reverse bends. The new design achieves a natural emittance of 42 pm-rad, enabling the production of X-rays up to 500 times brighter than those generated by the original APS. A key innovation of the upgrade is the implementation of a swap-out injection scheme, which replaces entire depleted bunches instead of performing traditional top-up injection. This approach enables on-axis injection to accommodate for the reduced dynamic aperture resulting from strong focusing. This paper outlines the commissioning process, shares initial operating experience with swap-out injection, and presents performance data for new systems such as the bunch-lengthening cavity.",
