          "abstract": "Hadron Collider Rings offer unprecedented opportunities to address fundamental scientific questions in particle and nuclear physics. To achieve these ambitious goals, the colliders must deliver exceptionally high levels of luminosity, hence require high intensity hadron beam in the ring, which leads to high beam-beam parameter, as well as comparable space charge effects. This study focuses on nonlinear effects that impact the beam dynamics within the hadron accelerator ring, including weak-strong beam-beam interactions and their interplay with space charge effects. Accurately predicting these non-linearities, particularly resonances arising during multi-turn acceleration, is critical for long beam lifetime and optimal accelerator performance. This work presents an initial attempt to develop an optimized approach that integrates space charge effects across the entire ring length while incorporating localized beam-beam interactions at specific interaction points.",

However, these simulations require material band structure parameters, which are not always available from experiments. This work aims to establish a reliable framework for calculating electronic band structure parameters using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Specifically, we apply this framework to investigate the effects of lattice strain and temperature on the electronic band structure and electron transport in GaAs. This approach will be further extended to explore band structure modifications in heavily p-doped semiconductors and to calculate electronic band structures of novel spin-polarized photocathode materials.",

We propose a proton bunch compression experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab to explore optimal radio frequency (RF) cavity and lattice configurations. IOTA is a compact fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics R&D that can circulate a 2.5-MeV proton beam with extreme space-charge. Using ImpactX and its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that bunch length can be rapidly reduced by a factor of at least two, without appreciable degradation in transverse beam quality, even under strong space-charge conditions. However, longitudinal defocusing presents a large effect in short-pulsed proton beams, and the optimization of bunch compression under such conditions is discussed.",

To ensure optimal performance, it is critical to accurately match the beam from the injectors to the HSR in six-dimensional phase space, in addition to the match of positions and angles. Inadequate matching can lead to emittance growth, which negatively impacts the achievable luminosity of the collider. This report outlines the key constraints involved in the matching process and presents a systematic approach to achieving high-fidelity beam matching while preserving emittance quality.",

The smallest RCS rings in this lattice are 6.28 km in circumference and the largest RCS ring fitting fully within the Fermilab site is 15.5 km. To reach 5 TeV per beam, a single tunnel containing up to two rings is allowed to exceed the 15.5 km limit. Each ring is either a conventional RCS or a hybrid RCS. A conventional RCS relies on only iron dominated, ramped field magnets while a hybrid RCS relies on a combination of interleaved ramped field and superconducting fixed field magnets to achieve higher average magnetic fields while maintaining the high ramp rates achievable with iron dominated magnets. A pair of 6.28 km RCS rings and a 15.5 km RCS ring accelerate beams from 63 GeV to 1.54 TeV. Three scenarios for acceleration from 1.54 TeV to 5 TeV using an off-site tunnel are presented.",

Ionization cooling is essential to reduce beam emittance and achieve required luminosities. As muons lose energy in absorbers, normal-conducting RF cavities restore it. However, strong magnetic fields—needed for beam focusing—increase the risk of RF cavity breakdowns. Thin beam windows are used to reduce breakdown probability and improve shunt impedance. In this paper, we present some recent studies on these cavities, including: 1) evaluating emittance growth due to particle scattering in the beam windows made of Be and Al by GEANT4, 2) calculating the beam loading effect in the presence of the beam windows with CST wakeifeld solver and Particle-In-Cell solver, 3) deriving the breakdown thresholds for different cavity materials in strong B fields based on a thermal-mechanical model.",

In this study, we investigate an alternative configuration that uses three quadrupole magnets to form a negative identity transport section between the TDCs instead of a negative drift. To assess the robustness of this proposed design, a computational study has been conducted on initial beam conditions to determine the operational limitations.

Resonant interactions between photons and atomic systems offer significantly enhanced resonant cross-sections, often several orders of magnitude greater than what is achievable through conventional Compton scattering of electron and photon beams. The Gamma Factory initiative at CERN aims to exploit this enhancement by employing ultra-relativistic, partially stripped ion beams to generate high-intensity gamma-ray beams. In this work, we first examine the energy-matching requirements for resonance. We then present a semi-classical model based on a damped-driven oscillator to describe resonant Compton scattering. This model provides physical insight into the resonant cross-section and the limitations imposed by beam-beam interactions. We also propose a framework for simulating the scattering process.",

Recent experimental evidence shows that this limitation can be mitigated by reducing the RF pulse length to a few nanoseconds. One key challenge in designing an accelerator operating in the short-pulse regime is achieving the required short filling time. In this work, we designed a novel waveguide power splitter to independently feed an array of accelerating cells. A prototype X-band waveguide array for a one-to-four power splitter has been developed to drive standing-wave cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. The power is designed to be equally split and fed into four cavities, with the desired phase advance per cavity. A 3D-printed prototype has been used for low-power microwave measurements (\"cold\" tests). The results, including measurements with a vector network analyzer and time-domain measurements, show good agreement with simulations. Ongoing work includes designing a multi-cell accelerator based on this concept for two-beam acceleration with few-nanosecond RF pulses.",

It has recently been successfully, experimentally, demonstrated in Fermilab's IOTA storage ring, marking a major step forward in beam cooling. OSC has the potential to significantly improve both the performance and flexibility as a beam cooling system. One promising way to boost OSC performance is by adding a high-gain optical amplifier. However, this amplifier must be carefully designed to meet the specific constraints of the OSC system. A major challenge lies in the limited optical delay, which is just 6 mm for the case of IOTA, set by the beam bypass, restricts us to use a short-length gain medium. This, along with IOTA’s high repetition rate and the relatively long duration of the optical pulses, limits the peak power available for the pump laser without damaging the crystal, which is crucial for achieving strong nonlinear gain. Additionally, it's essential to preserve the phase coherence of the undulator radiation during amplification, which further complicates the amplifier design. This report details a specialized amplifier setup that addresses these challenges, includes simulations of the integrated system, and summarizes the latest experimental progress and results.",

These geometries enable a comparative evaluation of the accelerating gradients and wakefield characteristics supported by each configuration. A key feature of this experiment is the use of a \"loading bunch\" to suppress the wakefield, demonstrating active control of energy transfer along the beam path. To directly measure wakefield suppression, a circular structure with an angled downstream cut was used to redirect coherent Cherenkov radiation into an autocorrelator for temporal diagnostics. Accelerating gradients were measured using a single-shot longitudinal phase space diagnostic, providing insight into geometry-dependent wakefield behavior.

In this study, we investigate the effects of light exposure on the surface of III-nitride photocathodes and the resulting changes in QE and photoemission, using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) for characterization. We demonstrate that exposing a GaN photocathode to a 240 nm wavelength laser at 870 µW for 15 minutes increases the QE by two orders of magnitude, with a maximum QE of 2.34 × 10⁻⁴ observed. Although III-nitride photocathodes are known for their robustness, our findings indicate that laser exposure can significantly alter their QE.

These are computationally expensive due to the need to solve the equations of motion for large numbers of charged particles in prescribed and self-consistent fields. We introduce a method that significantly reduces the computational burden by constructing approximate invariant densities via a two-step transfer operator approach. The method gives practical approximations to phase-space level curves, capturing essential dynamics without extensive particle pushing. Prior work has shown how to find such curves via kernel-based level set learning*. Our method is fast, avoids kernel tuning, and integrates with existing codes, enabling rapid assessment of figures of merit in constrained optimization algorithms such as Adjoint with a Chaser, AWC**. AWC efficiently computes gradients with respect to lattice parameters while preserving moment periodicity and accounting for self-fields and collective effects. We present results demonstrating accuracy, speed-up, and trade-offs between precision and computational cost in lattice design.",

This method employs an active transverse feedback system as a controlled source of impedance to induce a coherent beam instability. The beam’s resulting growth rate and transverse feedback parameters can then be used to directly measure the stability diagram, a threshold which maps the system's stability conditions. A proof-of-principle experiment of this measurement method was first explored at the LHC, where the experiment at IOTA aims to map out the entirety of the stability diagram and to obtain the beam distribution function from the stability diagram, a procedure never done before that would enable one to obtain the beam distribution tails. Here we present the initial results of stability diagram data analysis, simulation results, and plans for further investigation.",

Simulations show that the outgoing beam has a very small dispersion, independent of the periodic dispersion value at the septum. We show using a first-order normal form approximation that transforms to the Kobayashi Hamiltonian, how the dynamics of such a spill lead to a dispersion-free outgoing beam, which is critical to the uniformity requirements of the NSRL. Finally, we measure the dispersion of the beam by varying the flattop energy of the coasting beam in the booster before engaging the spill and show that the magnitude of dispersion is reduced by over a factor of 5 from the periodic value in the ring.",

This technique has been implemented in low (< 200 keV) beamlines at both Cornell university and Arizona State University. However, the technique poses several practical challenges. In this work, we analyze and address key issues affecting the 4D phase space and emittance measurements using this technique. We identify and investigate sources of inaccuracies like the pinhole aspect ratio, beam divergence, position-momentum correlations in the phase space, and the point-spread-function of the detector and suggest techniques to minimize them.

We report the first-ever characterization of dark (negative) solitons in an accelerator, emerging from negative perturbations in a regime of negative dispersion. We also report observing oscillatory wave structures from the KdV equation for the first time in an accelerator, arising from negative beam perturbations in a positive dispersion regime.

The study of transit time is important because transit time directly contributes to the beam response time during resonant extraction and thus knowing it apriori would be practically useful in designing of the extraction system. In this work, we shall investigate the analytical derivation of the transit time of particles (to the first order Kobayashi Hamiltonian) in different parts of the phase space distribution and compare against the analytical results.

Algorithms which are capable of tuning machine settings while keeping the performance within a desired threshold can be used to compensate for such drifts. We have developed a modified version of the Multi-Generation Gaussian Process Optimizer (MG-GPO) which is capable of tuning accelerator settings during user operation. The modified algorithm uses Gaussian Process regression to predict the performance of potential trial settings and removes ones with a high probability of giving too poor of a performance before selection for evaluation on the machine. The modified MG-GPO has been tested on analytic functions and applied to the SPEAR3 kicker-bump matching problem as a proof of concept. It is expected that the modified MG-GPO will be applied to maintain optimal trajectory of the beam injected into the SPEAR3 storage ring.",

However, the high sensitivity of these devices comes at the cost of a limited measurement range, even with high dynamic range electronics. Furthermore, CBPMs need to be calibrated in situ, ideally by introducing a known beam offset, which is often impractical in large installations. This paper reports on a method to match CBPM beam signals by injecting synchronized and tightly controlled bursts of radio frequency (RF) oscillations into the sensor cavity and reading back their superposition. The method allows compensation for static beam offsets (with beam) and calibrates CBPMs electronically (no beam required), thus removing some of the operational hurdles. We discuss the first demonstration of this method at the Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2)",

While similar laser techniques have been employed at Fermilab to enhance injection and extraction efficiency into the Booster, the work presented here focuses on extending these methods to bunch-by-bunch manipulation. This approach utilizes fine-scale correction of the H- bunches’ longitudinal spatial distribution. In theory, loosely confined particles in longitudinal phase space contribute to emittance growth during acceleration. By selectively removing these outlying particles through laser scraping (H- + γ → H + e-), this growth can be reduced. This report presents experimental results from both symmetric and asymmetric longitudinal scraping of H⁻ bunches in the Fermilab linac, which were subsequently injected into Booster, and evaluates the broader applicability of this method for future high-intensity accelerator operations.",

As these systems push toward more stringent performance goals, traditional control techniques often face limitations in responsiveness and robustness. In this talk, I will discuss how we’ve begun incorporating machine learning (ML) into feedback control loops to address some of these challenges. When integrated thoughtfully, ML models can provide fast, data-driven predictions and decisions that enhance control performance, particularly in complex environments. I will highlight several examples where ML has contributed to improved outcomes. At LBNL, ML-based feedback reduced the response time of complex laser combining systems by nearly an order of magnitude. On the BELLA Petawatt beamline, we performed the first experimental demonstration of ML-driven shot-to-shot laser pointing stabilization, addressing bandwidth limits in conventional control systems. We’ve also developed lightweight reinforcement learning algorithms for various control scenarios and begun implementing ML models on FPGAs for real-time MIMO control. These efforts are still ongoing, but suggest that ML can be a valuable and practical addition to modern control systems—offering improved precision, adaptability, and speed in demanding laser and accelerator environments.",

The DR contains 3 harmonic sextupoles that excite a third-integer resonance and three fast, tune-ramping quadrupole magnets that drive the horizontal tune towards the 29/3 resonance. In our initial work, the surrogate model trains on a semi-analytical simulation provided in the same format as live data. Using Reinforcement Learning (and other potential ML methods), the trained surrogate acts as the “environment” in which a simple ML control agent could learn to dynamically adjust the quadrupole ramp at 430 break points within the 43 microsecond spill window. The controller will be hosted on a dedicated Arria 10 FPGA. In this work, we report the accuracy and fidelity of the surrogate model in comparison to the response dynamics of the physics simulator.",

The composite target configuration and discharge conditions for co-sputtering were optimized to deposit Nb-Sn films on flat Nb substrates, followed by annealing to form Nb₃Sn. Multiple strategies have been explored to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb₃Sn coating, including optimizing a two-step annealing process, annealing in Sn vapor, and a light Sn recoating process. A 1.5 µm Nb-Sn co-sputtered film was deposited on the interior of a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity and annealed at 600 °C for 6 h, followed by 950 °C for 1 h. Cryogenic RF testing of the annealed cavity demonstrated a Tc of 17.8 K, confirming the formation of Nb₃Sn.

The hermetic assembly consists of a 2-cell 915 MHz SRF cavity, a coaxial fundamental power coupler and warm-to-cold transition beam tubes. The two-part shipping assembly consists of an inner frame, providing direct mounting of the components, and an outer frame mounted to the ground transport vehicle. The inner frame is then connected to the outer frame by way of wire-rope isolators. Accelerometer data from ground transportation of previous projects at Jefferson Lab provides the baseline for the expected frequency and magnitude of vibrational and shock events during transit. Modal analyses were carried out in ANSYS on the inner frame assembly and critical components to identify an appropriate wire-rope isolator configuration such that peak loads are mitigated and the incurred frequencies do not correspond with the fundamental modes of the structures.",

The remaining unbunched beam must be removed to avoid the production of undesirable ‘satellite’ bunches, which can quench the superconducting solenoids downstream during operation. In this paper, we present the design of a resonant sine-wave RF-structure that effectively removes the bunch ‘tails’ using a vertically deflecting kick.

The thyratrons have separate heaters for the cathode and reservoir, and each needs to maintain specific voltage and current levels for the thyratron to work properly. Currently, the method of measuring and adjusting these values requires locking out the system, opening the tank, and measuring the voltage and current of each heater, then adjusting two variable transformers by hand to reach the desired values. This controller consists of four analog-to-digital converters which will relay these measurements out of the modulator as digital signals through fiber optic transceivers.

Using CST Studio Suite, we simulate the eigenmode evolution as the geometry transforms from a pure cylindrical to a coaxial configuration. We track the behavior of TM010 through TM014 modes to observe the continuous evolution into the corresponding TEM0 through TEM4 modes of the coaxial cavity. The process is governed by the evolution of the electric field orientation as the geometry shifts, enabling the axial TM fields to reorient into the radial electric field configuration of TEM modes. Field patterns, eigen-frequencies, and mode indentities are analyzed throughtout the transition. The results provide simulation-based evidence that TM to TEM conversion occurs without generation of newer eigenmodes, offering a valuable insight into the design of transition regions in superconducting RF (SRF) systems and provides a foundation for experimental validation.",

This device has an output of 1.6 million volts DC. A converter is needed to transform this potential energy into useful electrical power. To achieve this the \"Pulsed Ion Reflex Klystron\" has been developed. The PIRK aims to achieve high conversion efficiencies by directing negatively charged ions through a re-entrant resonant cavity hundreds of times to gradually transfer energy from the moving particles to said cavity. Ions will be released into a 6-meter linear accelerator with roughly 1000 precisely spaced electrodes forming a quasi-parabolic potential. This potential is symmetric about the midpoint of the tube causing ions to oscillate with a frequency of approximately 1 MHz independent of energy. Perturbations to this parabolic potential are designed to provide radial electrostatic beam focusing. An algorithm is devised to produce optimal voltage curves to maximize both longitudinal bunching and radial confinement, and these curves are examined against practically realizable potentials. Energy is coupled out of the resonant cavity using a loop antenna connected to a silicon carbide rectifying diode. This converts the RF in the cavity to a 400V intermediate DC bus that can easily be inverted to wall power.",

We correlate these impurity profiles with detailed cavity performance measurements, including surface resistance and quality factor, and compare our findings with predictions from BCS theory. The results demonstrate that while both nitrogen and oxygen enhance performance, ten times more oxygen is required to achieve the same reduction in BCS resistance as interstitial nitrogen.

The new design achieves a natural emittance of 42 pm-rad, enabling the production of X-rays up to 500 times brighter than those generated by the original APS. A key innovation of the upgrade is the implementation of a swap-out injection scheme, which replaces entire depleted bunches instead of performing traditional top-up injection. This approach enables on-axis injection to accommodate for the reduced dynamic aperture resulting from strong focusing. This paper outlines the commissioning process, shares initial operating experience with swap-out injection, and presents performance data for new systems such as the bunch-lengthening cavity.",

The nano-beam scheme allows the extremely low beta function at the interaction point (IP) compared to the bunch length, namely ordinary colliders. The beta function at the IP is less than 1 mm which is the smallest value among the previous colliders. Recent results on beam-beam interactions, beam injection under the influence of beam-beam interactions, and a performance of the crab-waist scheme that improves the luminosity performance are discussed. Sudden beam loss (SBL), which cannot be explained by usual beam dynamics, and the nonlinear collimator as a key device to reduce both beam background and impedance are also crucial issues. We present the recent machine operation and performance of SuperKEKB which predicts the future high energy and luminosity colliders.",

These sources can be used in biological studies investigating improvements to radiation cancer therapy. Recently, the differential sparing effect on normal tissues versus tumors using the delivery of high radiation doses >10 Gy at extremely high dose rates (DR), called FLASH effect, has received increasing attention. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the sparing effect are not yet fully understood. To explore these mechanisms, we have implemented a beamline at the BELLA PW that delivers LD proton bunches at ultra-high instantaneous DR (UHIDR) up to $10^8$ Gy/s. This allowed us to investigate in vivo the acute skin damage and late radiation-induced fibrosis in mouse ears after UHIDR with 10 MeV LD protons and prescribed doses of several 10 Gy. We observe sparing of healthy mouse ear tissue after irradiations with LD proton bunches at UHIDR compared to irradiations with 300 kV x-rays at clinical dose rates and similar total dose. Recent improvements to the LD proton source, delivery beamline, and diagnostic suite have also enabled first peptide sample irradiations to explore the sparing effect on the molecular level. This talk will provide a summary of radiobiology research activities at the BELLA PW.",

Algorithms which are capable of tuning machine settings while keeping the performance within a desired threshold can be used to compensate for such drifts. We have developed a modified version of the Multi-Generation Gaussian Process Optimizer (MG-GPO) which is capable of tuning accelerator settings during user operation. The modified algorithm uses Gaussian Process regression to predict the performance of potential trial settings and removes ones with a high probability of giving too poor of a performance before selection for evaluation on the machine. The modified MG-GPO has been tested on analytic functions and applied to the SPEAR3 kicker-bump matching problem as a proof of concept. It is expected that the modified MG-GPO will be applied to maintain optimal trajectory of the beam injected into the SPEAR3 storage ring.",

We propose Latent Evolution Model (LEM), a hybrid machine learning framework with an autoencoder that projects high-dimensional phase spaces into lower-dimensional representations, coupled with transformers to learn temporal dynamics in the latent space. This approach provides a common foundational framework addressing multiple interconnected challenges in beam diagnostics. For *forward modeling*, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) encodes 15 unique projections of the 6D phase space into a latent representation, while a transformer predicts downstream latent states from upstream inputs. For *inverse problems*, we address two distinct challenges: (a) predicting upstream phase spaces from downstream observations by utilizing the pretrained CVAE with transformers trained on reversed temporal sequences, and (b) estimating RF settings from the latent space of the trained LEM using a dedicated dense neural network that maps latent representations to RF parameters. For *tuning problems*, we leverage the trained LEM and RF estimator within a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal RF settings that minimize beam loss. This paper summarizes our recent efforts and demonstrates how this unified approach effectively addresses these traditionally separate challenges.",

While most of these variables are constrained within predefined boundary conditions, slow fluctuations over extended periods—from tens of minutes to a full day—can still significantly degrade beam performance. Due to their gradual nature and the difficulty in distinguishing meaningful trends from background noise, such variables often go unnoticed and remain unoptimized by operators for days. This study investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to identify and analyze these slow-moving variables. By applying advanced time-series analysis and feature importance ranking, the proposed approach reveals hidden correlations between slow variable drifts and a key beam quality metric: the ring loss at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to detect subtle anomalies and offer actionable insights to mitigate persistent beam quality issues that can disrupt operations for weeks at a time.",

Variations in environmental factors and Ion Source output result in day-to-day longitudinal phase drift leading to increased beam loss.

This work explores machine learning-based automation of drift correction using data-driven modeling of the Linac behavior. After extensive experimentation with single-layer, multi-layer, and convolutional neural networks (CNN+NN), we now adopt a prototype-based classification approach to identify optimal correction strategies. The model leverages a reduced 34-dimensional feature set comprising 7 RF cavity settings and 27 Beam Position Monitor (BPM) phase readings. To model the beam longitudinal response, we construct a 7×27 response matrix by varying the 7 cavity phases. Due to the limited set real-world data, synthetic data generation from the response matrix is also being explored to enhance model training. This enables the simulation of diverse drift scenarios and improves the generalizability of learned corrections. Finally, in addition to the prototypical loss framework, we incorporate a surrogate energy-consistent loss that penalizes inconsistencies between predicted phase corrections and changes in beam energy—estimated from the 27 BPM readings—alongside a temporal smoothness constraint that discourages abrupt prediction shifts across sequential readings.",

As charged particles traverse a foil, the outgoing particles exhibit a Gaussian-like angular distribution.

We utilize the Bmad and SRIM computer codes to calculate the energy loss through the foils for different ion species, energies, and charge states. After preparing ion beam species in the Booster, we determine the energy loss by measuring the horizontal beam profile at the multi-wire MW063 location in the NSRL beamline.

By compositing many BPMs together, it becomes possible to improve the quality of the quadrupole signal.

However, the high sensitivity of these devices comes at the cost of a limited measurement range, even with high dynamic range electronics. Furthermore, CBPMs need to be calibrated in situ, ideally by introducing a known beam offset, which is often impractical in large installations. This paper reports on a method to match CBPM beam signals by injecting synchronized and tightly controlled bursts of radio frequency (RF) oscillations into the sensor cavity and reading back their superposition. The method allows compensation for static beam offsets (with beam) and calibrates CBPMs electronically (no beam required), thus removing some of the operational hurdles. We discuss the first demonstration of this method at the Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2)",

Based on the initial prototype of the 2D EOS-BPM, using 1 pair of crystals, installed at SLAC FACET-II, this 3D design has undergone several iterations. A fully functional prototype was manufactured and bench tested using Off-Axis Parabolic (OAP) mirrors to focus the laser on 2 sets of 2 crystals. However, due to the difficulty of working with OAPs and the offset of the crystal pairs, a new EOS-BPM was developed using an axicon lens to shape the laser into an annulus at the crystal plane. This dramatically simplifies the setup, reduces its footprint, and provides full 3D information from a single laser beam. Once installed, the EOS-BPM can yield the full 3D centroid positioning of two bunches in a wakefield accelerator, or the tilt of a beam used to power a light source. Under ideal conditions, simulation-based estimates show temporal and transverse resolution for the beam centroids of a two-bunch wakefield accelerator beam of order 50 fs and 1 μm, respectively.",

          "title": "Calculating beam extinction in a pulsed proton beam using FPGA-based peak detection127The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab imposes stringent requirements on the elimination of out-of-time beam in its pulsed proton beam, a requirement known as “extinction”. Utilizing a new μTCA-based FPGA data acquisition system, we recorded live particle data from scattered particles incident on an array of quartz Cherenkov radiators and photomultiplier tubes to measure the extinction in the inter-pulse gaps in the pulsed proton beam. Minuscule errors in the derived signal period can make a measurement of the extinction impossible, so after taking a Fourier transform, further optimizations on the period were done based on the assumption that the signal period is stable over the full time of the beam spill while it is being resonantly extracted. After these optimizations, the beam extinction was shown to be on the level of $10^3$.",

Direct measurements of the beam in the Cyclotron are challenging due to the harsh environment, including high radiation, strong magnetic fields, RF interference, and spatial constraints. To address this, we are developing a novel beam probe capable of resolving longitudinal bunch structure across 16 positions simultaneously. The fast beam probe consists of a segmented fast plastic scintillator array coupled via fiber optics to external Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), mounted on a radially translating probe. We report on the probe's performance from in-air tests at the general-purpose beamline.

A specialized Spill Regulation System (SRS) has been developed to help achieve consistent spill uniformity. The system is based on a custom-designed carrier board featuring an Arria 10 SoC, capable of executing real-time feedback control. The FPGA processes beam pulses of approximately 200 ns every 1.695 microsecond, allowing for continuous monitoring of the extracted spill intensity through fast bunch integration. The system directly controls three quadrupole magnets, which work in conjunction with sextupole magnets to achieve third-order resonant extraction. Furthermore, the board interfaces with Fermilab’s Accelerator Control Network (ACNET), enabling operators to modify spill regulation settings in real-time via the control network while providing diagnostic waveforms. These waveforms help operators monitor the process and fine-tune the feedback mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of the board's architecture and its initial progress toward regulating beam extraction. This initial version of the regulation system aims to evaluate baseline performance to inform future system improvements.",

Because neutrons are produced via DD fusion with a peak cross section of 0.1 barns, even modest initial luminosities yield event rates suitable for real-time measurements and lifetime monitoring. The proposed luminosity monitor is based on neutron moderation and absorption and subsequent gamma-ray detection. Sodium chloride serves as the moderator, with most neutrons absorbed by chlorine-35 nuclei having a thermal neutron absorption cross section of 43.6 barns.

The age of the legacy system has led to difficulties in maintaining the hardware due to parts going obsolete without suitable drop in replacements. Continued operation of the legacy system is required as the installation of LLRF 3.0 systems is costly and cannot be completed in a short period of time with the available resources. The most pressing failure in the legacy system was a failing buffer card, which is responsible for communication between the EPICs network and individual RF control modules. A new buffer card was designed as a transparent, drop in, replacement so that upgrades are simply a matter of swapping the existing legacy hardware.

Recently, it has been proposed this beamline could be used to convert a microscale transverse modulation created by a TEM grid into a microbunch train in the longitudinal plane.* Such a technique would be useful for obtaining nano-scale microbunching that does not rely on the sensitive process of FEL gain. This new approach has been proposed to enable development of a compact free-electron laser at Arizona State, greatly reducing size and cost compared with existing short wavelength FELs. To perform an exploratory demonstration of this concept at AWA, this experiment requires low normalized emittance (~50 nm*rad), low charge (~1pC) electron bunches, and transverse diagnostics with high-resolution (1-3 microns) and high-light-collection to resolve the modulation on the electron beam.

These parameters can be constrained by beam position and profile measurements. We use Bayesian statistical inference to estimate the parameters, and their uncertainties, probabilistically by calibrating the Bmad digital twin to beam measurements. The inference is computationally accelerated using a machine learning emulator of the physical accelerator digital twin trained to a perturbed-parameter ensemble of Bmad simulations.

This issue was traced to vertical deformation of the insertion device vacuum chamber (IDVC) due to temperature differences with its strongback. Direct measurements of temperature and vertical displacement of IDVC in a selected sector of the APS storage ring confirmed this effect, and simulations successfully reproduced the thermal deformation mechanism. To address the issue, we developed a simple mechanical constraint to limit the vertical displacement, rather than actively compensating for the temperature difference through enhanced heat transfer. This paper reports the investigations, proposed mechanical solution, simulation, and measurement validation after its installation. Post-installation tests successfully demonstrated its effectiveness, allowing the IDs to reach the minimum gap without triggering the limit switch.",

Due to its high-intensity operation, the PSR also functions as a highly-sensitive mass spectrometer for the entire accelerator complex. Changes in PSR beam losses are more responsive to linac drifts than any other diagnostic system, making continuous monitoring and characterization of the PSR critical to overall performance. Currently, PSR operation is primarily guided by beam loss signals, while key physics parameters—such as the betatron tune, closed orbit, and injection offsets—are typically measured only once per day. Furthermore, Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) can only provide meaningful data a single 290-ns-long injection, requiring dedicated machine time and resulting in operational downtime. However, recent upgrades to both the data acquisition and chopper systems now enable continuous measurements during standard operation. In this work, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on simulated data to infer critical beam parameters in real-time. This approach will be tested and implemented during the 2025 run cycle to enable online monitoring and improved control of PSR beam dynamics.",

It consists of two sensor planes which have arrays of thin conducting wires aligned vertically and horizontally, respectively. It monitors beam profiles in two transverse directions to the beam axis by measuring the net-charge depositions in the sensor wires, which are caused by ejection of secondary electrons and delta rays driven by electromagnetic interactions with high-energy protons. The net charge deposition in a sensing wire linearly correlates with the number of incident protons on it. This correlation is perturbed when the wire interacts with secondary electrons and delta rays originating from beam-matter interactions in neighboring wires, PBW and residual gases. In this paper, we analyze the physical phenomena that affects the measurement uncertainties of the harp using particle transport simulations.",

This BPM plays a crucial role in the SCU assembly ensuring precise beam alignment with sub-micron resolution. The BPM incorporates two rectangular cavities for X- and Y-position measurements and a cylindrical reference cavity, all housed within a single copper block. Each cavity is separated by approximately 30 mm, which eliminates crosstalk between channels. The design of each cavity includes a single WR-75 waveguide port with a ceramic window as vacuum-air interface for out-coupling the EM field from the cavity to the external circuit. Additionally, each cavity is equipped with a tuner pin for resonant frequency adjustments. In this work, we report on the RF characterization of the BPM cavities conducted at both room and cryogenic temperatures. A consistent resonant frequency shift of approximately 37 MHz was observed when cooling the cavities from room temperature to 40 K, which is the nominal operating temperature within the undulator cryomodule. These measurements validate the predictions made during the BPM design phase through simulations. We also discuss future plans and possible applications beyond the SCU project.",

Undamped higher order modes (HOMs) from these cavities pose a risk of instability under the new APS conditions. Dimtel iGp12 processor-based bunch-by-bunch Longitudinal Feedback (LFB) system is developed to address longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities caused by HOMs. These instabilities are exacerbated by the reduced synchrotron frequency and faster growth rates in presence of bunch lengthening system. The mitigation strategy involves initially reducing growth rates through precise cavity temperature tuning, followed by employing the LFB system to effectively manage residual growth rates. Resonance cavity temperatures of the HOMs have been characterized under APS conditions, providing a reference for tuning in the upgraded APS operation. The LFB system is designed to operate in both phase and energy sensing modes. This paper presents the feedback configuration, initial commissioning results with phase and energy sensing modes, and the feedback setup for operations.",

This is in pursuit of smoothly extracting circulating beam to the Mu2e Experiment’s production target, whereby the goal is to extract a uniform slice of the circulating 1e12 protons in the DR over 25,000 turns (43 ms). The DR contains 3 harmonic sextupoles that excite a third-integer resonance and three fast, tune-ramping quadrupole magnets that drive the horizontal tune towards the 29/3 resonance. In our initial work, the surrogate model trains on a semi-analytical simulation provided in the same format as live data. Using Reinforcement Learning (and other potential ML methods), the trained surrogate acts as the “environment” in which a simple ML control agent could learn to dynamically adjust the quadrupole ramp at 430 break points within the 43 microsecond spill window.

The main RF system is significantly affected by ambient 60 Hz-harmonics noise, complicating the measurement of synchrotron frequency under varying higher harmonic cavity conditions. To address this, using Dimtel iGp12 processor-based longitudinal feedback system we developed two methods to measure synchrotron frequency effectively. Our approach involves driving multi-bunch beam modes by considering a span for synchrotron frequency sideband and analyzing mode amplitude changes across the sweep frequency range. The \"slow\" method scans fixed drive frequencies within a range, recording the beam response at each frequency. The “fast” approach drives the beam with a broadband chirp signal and analyzes the resulting single mode spectrum data. Both methods are tested during beam studies. Synchrotron frequency changes are measured in two setups: First, adjusting BLS voltage manually while keeping beam current constant. Second, BLS voltage varying as a function of decaying beam current. This paper presents, details of the measurement procedure and results from the beam-based machine studies.",

We present a method to efficiently reconstruct the full 5×5 beam sigma matrix (excluding the time coordinates) at the booster-to-storage-ring (BTS) transport line at the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U). Earlier works demonstrated that the beam sigma matrix can be accurately reconstructed using linear transport matrices under the assumption of negligible chromatic effects. However, the presence of chromaticity introduced significant non-linearities and leads to discrepancies from the linear approaches. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach leveraging Cheetah, a differentiable beam dynamics simulation framework, to enable direct gradient-based optimization of the beam matrix. Initial results shows efficient and accurate reconstruction under both linear and second-order tracking models, providing improved robustness in simulation studies. This method offers a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient alternative to black-box methods for beam matrix reconstruction in transport lines in presence of complex effects.",

Through a series of upgrades, particularly in the last two decades, the linac's performance has significantly improved. Reconfigurations of the low-energy and medium-energy beam transport systems have been key contributors to this progress. Key improvement include: A 50% increase in transmission for high-peak-current isotope production, a 50% reduction in transverse emittance and A dramatic three-order-of-magnitude reduction in beam loss. These upgrades and has significantly enhanced the overall performance and efficiency of the BNL 200 MeV linac.",

One of the primary limitations for maximum proton pulse intensity is beam loss between the H$^-$ stripper foil and the first dipole magnet downstream of the foil. One of the major beam losses in this region, referred to as “first-turn losses,” are due to incomplete stripping of the injected H$^-$ beam into H$^+$ during the injection process. First-turn losses not only result in a lower extracted proton pulse intensity but can also result in longer maintenance periods following beam runs due to the activation of PSR components, which require “cooling down” prior to any hands-on maintenance. In this work, a detailed particle-tracking model of the PSR injection system was created using the simulation package General Particle Tracer (GPT) using three C++ custom elements created to simulate foil scattering, foil stripping, and Lorentz stripping. The model was used to study the effect of different stripper foil parameters and different injection offsets on first-turn losses and emittance growth. The simulation model will be described, and the simulation results will be presented at the conference.",

By leveraging the differences in work function and electronic structure between different materials, we enabled spatially localized photoemission, resulting in picometer-scale emittance from a flat photocathode. We also investigated space charge effects by measuring how the emission spot size, as measured in a photoemission electron microscope, changes with the number of electrons emitted per laser pulse. When more than one electron is emitted simultaneously, Coulomb repulsion causes a substantial broadening of the observed source size, enabling us to investigate the limitations imposed by vacuum space charge forces during pulsed photoemission. Our results highlight the potential of nanoscale photoemitters as high-brightness electron sources and offer new insights into electron correlations that emerge after ultrafast photoemission.",

The present RF controls for the legacy cavities report at only 1 Hz, which is too slow to detectfast transient instabilities during these trip events. These challenges make the identification of an unstable cavity out of the hundreds installed at CEBAF a difficult and time-consuming task. To tackle these issues, a fast data acquisition system (DAQ) for the legacy SRF cavities has been developed, which records the sample at 5 kHz. An unsupervised learning framework has been developed to identify anomalous SRF cavity behavior. We will discuss the present status of the DAQ system and our framework, along with recent successes in detecting anomalous cavity behavior. Overall, our method offers a practical solution for identifying unstable SRF cavities, contributing to increased beam availability and machine reliability.",

The proposed Particle Accelerator Lattice Standard aims to promote: (i) portability between applications, (ii) a unified open-access description for scientific data (publishing and archiving), (iii) a unified description for post-processing, visualization and analysis.

One such system, based on an elliptic potential, has been extensively studied at the IOTA storage ring at Fermilab. The analysis of strongly nonlinear dynamics with multi-particle bunches is challenging due to the rapid decoherence of kicked beams. IOTA has the capability to track single electrons using linear multi-anode photomultiplier tubes for simultaneously measuring transverse coordinates and arrival times of synchrotron-radiation pulses. This technology enables the full reconstruction of turn-by-turn positions and momenta in all three planes for a single particle. Using this apparatus, we measured the dependence of small-amplitude tunes on the strength of the nonlinear magnet, as well as tunes dependence on oscillations amplitudes.",

However, it is often observed in accelerator simulations that the crossing speed, defined as the slope of the amplitude-dependent spin tune with respect to the machine azimuth, changes at the moment of resonance crossing. For example, the behavior of the amplitude-dependent spin tune in the vicinity of a higher-order spin-orbit resonance can often be reasonably approximated by such a piecewise-linear function. In this paper, we derive an extension to the Froissart-Stora formula which describes the asymptotic polarization loss in the case of changing crossing speed. We then demonstrate that this formula provides a good estimate of the polarization lost when crossing a higher-order spin-orbit resonance in both a toy model and simulations of RHIC.",

To quantify this, we construct the time-average of spin rotation matrices beginning at a certain phase space point. It is recognized that the ISF vector at that point achieves the matrix-norm, meaning that the ISF corresponds to the first right-singular vector of that matrix.

However, misalignment between the solenoid field and the beam trajectory can result in degraded emittance compensation due to orbit kicks, dispersive effects, and non-linearities in the magnetic field profile. This paper presents a technique for beam-based measurement of solenoid misalignments, using expressions derived from a hard-edged solenoid linear transfer matrix with known beam parameters.

This contribution presents recent studies of synchro-betatron resonances --- particularly the coupling resonance $2\\nu_x-2\\nu_y+p\\nu_z=0$ --- that can induce emittance transfer between the horizontal and vertical planes and limit luminosity performance. We identify the hourglass effect, caused by the proton bunch length being comparable to the vertical beta functions of both beams at the interaction point (IP), as the dominant source driving this resonance. We further investigate how physical noise, such as intra-beam scattering and fluctuations in the electron orbit and beam size, couples with the beam-beam interaction to amplify emittance growth and reduce luminosity. Mitigation strategies are also discussed. These studies provide important guidance for future EIC operation and inform strategies for potential upgrades.",

Effective mitigation of beam halo is essential for the cooler design based on Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), which must deliver an electron beam with average beam current of 100 mA and a charge 1 nC per bunch. In the ERL injector and booster linacs, space charge effects are stronger due to relatively low beam energy (6 MeV). Additionally, the longer bunch length of approximately 100 ps in this regime vs the RF period of 5.08 ns makes the formation of beam halos more likely. Therefore, effective collimation of beam halo is critical to maintaining the required beam parameters. To design an effective collimation scheme, several halo distributions were generated at the cathode and used to study halo formation within the injector-merger. This paper presents different halo distributions and halo formation, providing insights on halo collimation strategy.",

Direct emission of fusion daughters generates the exhaust velocities required for spacecraft speeds in excess of 1% of the speed of light. Past attempts at nuclear fusion energy production with colliding beams have been limited by Coulomb scattering, a deficiency overcome in this collider architecture. Instead of using fusion fuels such as p/Li7 and He3/He3 capable of generating the required thrust characteristics, this prototype employs deuterons. DD fusion produces neutrons that provide a convenient luminosity detection channel. The commissioning campaign described in this paper operates the collider at a peak beam kinetic energy of 60 keV at the interaction point.

In this case, Boussard argued that the microwave instability threshold can be found using the predictions of an infinite (coasting) beam, with the average current replaced by the peak current*. We revisit this problem, and theoretically show that if the variation of the synchrotron tune with energy can be neglected then Boussard's hypothesis holds provided 1) the longitudinal ring impedance is dominated by frequencies much shorter that the inverse bunch length; 2) the single-particle wakefield is much shorter than the bunch length, or, equivalently, the impedance is slowly varying over frequencies longer than the inverse bunch length; 3) the resulting instability has a sudden onset with growth rate of the order of the synchrotron frequency. The first two conditions imply that perturbations are localized within distances much less than the bunch length, while the last condition means that the instability experiences significant growth before the particles can make one synchrotron oscillation. While these conditions may be ``obvious'' in retrospect, we believe that the last two have not been clearly stated or widely appreciated.",

Using traditional electron cooling this racetrack shaped storage ring uses one straight section to cool the protons and the other one to enhance the radiation damping of the electrons using 2.4 T wigglers. These sections comprise the majority of the ring and are connected by short arcs. Space for sextupoles and octupoles is made in short straight sections between the wigglers. The strong wigglers and limited space for correction magnets create challenges in finding a suitable dynamic aperture correction. In this paper, we outline the challenges present in rings of this type and present a correction scheme that meets the aperture requirements of the design.",

These resonances reduce the Dynamic Aperture (DA), leading to increased beam loss. This study presents simulations of DA as a function of tune in the Recycler Ring, incorporating chaos indicators such as the Reversibility Error Method (REM) and Frequency Map Analysis (FMA). The effectiveness of existing resonance mitigation strategies is evaluated by quantifying their ability to delay DA degradation.

We introduce a method that significantly reduces the computational burden by constructing approximate invariant densities via a two-step transfer operator approach. The method gives practical approximations to phase-space level curves, capturing essential dynamics without extensive particle pushing. Prior work has shown how to find such curves via kernel-based level set learning*. Our method is fast, avoids kernel tuning, and integrates with existing codes, enabling rapid assessment of figures of merit in constrained optimization algorithms such as Adjoint with a Chaser, AWC**. AWC efficiently computes gradients with respect to lattice parameters while preserving moment periodicity and accounting for self-fields and collective effects.

Resolving fascinating satellite diffraction peaks in a compact UED beamline requires high angular magnification. In this work, we describe the implementation of post-sample angular magnification using a pair of compact permanent magnet solenoid lenses. Configured as an objective-eyepiece pair, these lenses achieve a camera length of 50 meters, i.e., the lens system is equivalent to extending the beamline drift length by a factor 15.

First, ABCI was used to determine the resonant frequency of the cylindrical corrugated waveguide with different lengths. The corresponding results were taken as a reference to examine the simulation method in the ANSYS HFSS environment. The eigenmode solver of ANSYS HFSS was used to determine different resonant frequencies. This was followed by examining a cylindrical corrugated waveguide that was implemented having a length of 17 mm for different conductor settings. The corresponding waveguide was fed by a plane wave having a resonant frequency that satisfies the intersection of the light line and dispersion curve of the corresponding mode. The analysis showed that the maximum loss factor was achieved at 39.20 and 40.07 GHz using ANSYS HFSS simulation data for different conductors, whereas ABCI resulted in 38.50 GHz.

Due to the structure of the T-BMT equation, the spin-transfer quaternion of a magnet is generally a nonlinear function of the entrance coordinates even if the phase-space motion is linear. This nonlinear function can be written as a Dyson expansion, for example as employed in the program SPRINT, which normalized the first-order expansion of the spin-transfer quaternion. Alternatively, this nonlinear function can be written as a Magnus expansion. This paper points out that in cases where the phase-space coordinates change little, as is generally the case for accelerator elements, the Magnus expansion is a much more appropriate method to describe the nonlinear spin motion because this expansion terminates after the first term when the phase-space coordinates are constant. We will demonstrate, with several examples, that an approximation based on the Magnus expansion leads to very good agreement with time-consuming numerical integration, and to significantly better agreement than obtained with historical codes like SPRINT.",

This method employs an active transverse feedback system as a controlled source of impedance to induce a coherent beam instability. The beam’s resulting growth rate and transverse feedback parameters can then be used to directly measure the stability diagram, a threshold which maps the system's stability conditions. A proof-of-principle experiment of this measurement method was first explored at the LHC, where the experiment at IOTA aims to map out the entirety of the stability diagram and to obtain the beam distribution function from the stability diagram, a procedure never done before that would enable one to obtain the beam distribution tails. Here we present the initial results of stability diagram data analysis, simulation results, and plans for further investigation.",

While beam losses caused by partially stripped neutral hydrogen atoms are a primary concern, interactions between the circulating beam and the injection foil also play a significant role in overall beam loss. Each stored proton interacts with the foil 30 times on average. As a result, large-angle scattering is a dominant cause of beam losses in beam dynamics simulations. To mitigate these effects, a set of bump magnets is employed to gradually move the closed orbit away from the foil during the accumulation process. In this work, we first compare various foil scattering algorithms used in ring simulations against results from Monte Carlo (MC) codes. We then quantify the impacts of different bumping schemes, assess uncertainties related to injection offsets, generate interaction 2d-distribution on the foil for heat load simulations, and evaluate the effects of different injected beam distributions.",

Parameters of the Linac beam affect Booster performance and therefore quantifying them is important. The longitudinal bunch parameters are reconstructed using a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM) installed in the middle of the Linac. For that, the bunch length is measured as a function of the phase of an upstream cavity and fitted to simulations. The cavity gradient and its phase with respect to the beam are recovered from readings of Beam Position Monitors. Since the cavity provides a significant transverse defocusing, the BSM measurements are correlated with transverse beam size measurements by a wire scanner.

In this work, we consider a beam traversing a chicane with larger cm-scale separations on each dipole, necessitating the combined use of longitudinal profile shaping and shielding to reduce emittance growth.

Our results indicate current profiles that differ to results derived without shielding** and allow for effective mitigation of emittance growth at cm-scale gaps.

This allows for the novel possibility of placing multiple interaction regions in series, achieving additive luminosity without introducing significant disruption. However, to get higher luminosity, the beta functions at the IP reaches millimeter scale, which in turn adds significant chromatic contribution to the collider. Correcting these chromatic effects is essential to maintain beam stability and ensure high luminosity during collider operation. By carefully adjusting the phase advance between two IRs that are placed in series, it becomes possible to cancel chromaticity globally, enabling stable collider operation while preserving high luminosity.

Transverse focusing is performed by 32 quadrupoles, and the beam orbit is guided by 19 dipole correctors and measured by 29 BPMs. The bunch length is measured in a single location by a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM). This paper presents a three-step reconstruction of the machine optics. First, the transverse and longitudinal Twiss parameters at the start of the SCL section are determined using quadrupole scans and BSM measurements at different settings of an upstream cavity. Second, the quadrupole calibrations are adjusted based on differential-trajectory measurements. Finally, the beam is propagated along the SCL linac using the code TraceWin. A comparison between TraceWin simulations and the beam envelope measured by the 12 wire scanners of the SCL linac was performed. Transverse and longitudinal beam parameters at the entrance and exit of the SCL section will be reported.",

The Pinhole Scan Technique measures the 4D phase space and hence the emittance by measuring the beam profile after clipping the beam using a pinhole followed by a drift section and then scanning the beam over the pinhole. This technique has been implemented in low (< 200 keV) beamlines at both Cornell university and Arizona State University. However, the technique poses several practical challenges. In this work, we analyze and address key issues affecting the 4D phase space and emittance measurements using this technique. We identify and investigate sources of inaccuracies like the pinhole aspect ratio, beam divergence, position-momentum correlations in the phase space, and the point-spread-function of the detector and suggest techniques to minimize them. Our findings offer a pathway to more accurate 4D phase space characterization in advanced electron beam systems.",

To avoid spin-orbital resonances, the alternating sum of the rotation axes of all snakes is 90 degrees, ensuring the closed-orbit spin tune is ½ and sufficiently far away from betatron tunes and integer tunes. This choice does not account for amplitude-dependent spin tune (ADST) shift, which introduces high-order spin orbit resonances in the vicinity of strong first-order resonances. By varying betatron phase advances across each of the 6 arcs, we minimize the strength of first-order spin-orbit resonances as well as ADST shift. In the case of uncooled helium-3, we find it is necessary to minimally vary the vertical orbital tune as well but are able to completely avoid depolarization throughout the ramp with time-dependent phase advances.",

This study focuses on nonlinear effects that impact the beam dynamics within the hadron accelerator ring, including weak-strong beam-beam interactions and their interplay with space charge effects. Accurately predicting these non-linearities, particularly resonances arising during multi-turn acceleration, is critical for long beam lifetime and optimal accelerator performance.

However, strong magnetic fields—needed for beam focusing—increase the risk of RF cavity breakdowns. Thin beam windows are used to reduce breakdown probability and improve shunt impedance. In this paper, we present some recent studies on these cavities, including: 1) evaluating emittance growth due to particle scattering in the beam windows made of Be and Al by GEANT4, 2) calculating the beam loading effect in the presence of the beam windows with CST wakeifeld solver and Particle-In-Cell solver, 3) deriving the breakdown thresholds for different cavity materials in strong B fields based on a thermal-mechanical model.",

We show theoretically and through simulation that these nonlinear effects can produce damping several orders of magnitude stronger than predicted by linear theory. Experimental evidence validates these findings. A quadrupole scan performed in the FACET-II dogleg reveals that an interaction between coherent betatron oscillations and transfer map nonlinearities shifts the point of minimal damping away from the expected linear condition of $R_{51}=0$.

This work will show the current status of the most mature design, which includes matching solutions, as well as options for extraction of the beam.",

In this work, we developed and implemented an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta (RK) integrator into Zgoubi to tackle growing computational demands in accelerator physics simulations. This new integrator complements Zgoubi's default solver, offering users the flexibility to choose between integration methods based on specific simulation requirements. We demonstrated that the adaptive step-size RK integrator achieves the necessary accuracy and performance for integrating the Lorentz and Thomas-BMT equations effectively. A key advantage of Zgoubi lies in its wide optical elements library, featuring over 60 accelerator components and variants, which the new adaptive step-size RK integrator can seamlessly utilize. Developed and rigorously tested over decades across numerous projects, this library provides a high degree of confidence in the code’s reliability. The same advantage holds about ancillary computations such as synchrotron radiation, space charge, decay in flight, etc. The implementation of the adaptive step-size RK integrator supports Zgoubi’s adaptability, enabling simulations of complex beam and spin dynamics with a trusted and well-established computational framework.",

Transit time is defined as the number of turns a particle takes to get extracted once it is in the unstable region in the phase space, i.e., outside the triangular separatrix in case of third-integer resonance. The study of transit time is important because transit time directly contributes to the beam response time during resonant extraction and thus knowing it apriori would be practically useful in designing of the extraction system. In this work, we shall investigate the analytical derivation of the transit time of particles (to the first order Kobayashi Hamiltonian) in different parts of the phase space distribution and compare against the analytical results. We also compare the simulation result of the transit time of particles (with higher statistics) for the static as well as dynamic extraction conditions cases, particularly in the context of resonant extraction parameters for Mu2e experiment at Fermilab.",

Interferometry of THz based e-beam and pump laser THz signals is a natural path towards this goal. As a first step, a detection scheme will be developed in a lab using laser pulses. The second step involves extracting the electron beam signal from a 100 GHz accelerating structure. Subsequently, both pump and electron beam signals are combined, filtered, amplified, and a temporal analysis can be performed. This proposal is for experimental detection and characterization of such signals, which arises from electron beam wakefield excitation of electromagnetic fields in a 100/200 GHz accelerating structure combined with a pump derived signal.",

At its core, a differentiable simulation does not only solve a forward problem, but additionally provides gradients of output parameters (e.g. beam parameters) with respect to input parameters (e.g. beamline or source parameters). How to effectively program large dynamic simulations differentiably is still an open question, but there is general consensus that a “single-source” approach aided by automatic differentiation (AD) is desirable. Addressing this, there are a) emerging domain-specific languages in machine learning that are intrinsically differentiable, and b) highly-performing & scalable, general-purpose languages like ISO C++ of existing codes. The challenge of approach a) is syntax specialization, which can limit ease of implementation & performance for physics algorithms, while b) requires additional work for A",

This behavior is attributed to resonance streaming around the synchro-betatron resonance $2\\nu_x-2\\nu_y+p\\nu_z=0$, which enables unidirectional emittance transfer from the horizontal to the vertical plane. We further show that horizontal cooling alone cannot suppress the vertical growth, confirming that dedicated vertical cooling is essential for preserving the flat beam profile in high-luminosity EIC operation.",

This contribution provides a brief review of the domestic industrial vendor space, an outlook of the global demand for SRF cavities and an outline of the challenges leading to this supply chain deficiency. One of the main challenges towards establishing a robust domestic SRF industry has been the large uncertainty in the demand.

This is because the suitability of a radionuclide for a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical application will depend on many factors including, but not limited to, the decay mode (e.g. α- vs β-emitter), the particle emission range, the matching of its half-life to the pharmacokinetics of the drug, and the co-emission of gamma rays of appropriate energy for imaging.

As requirements extend into high-repetition-rate and nonlinear regimes, traditional strategies increasingly struggle to deliver the necessary speed and adaptability. This talk presents two cases where machine learning (ML) enhances deterministic feedback control. In both, ML models—trained on experimental or simulated data—provide rapid predictions to guide real-time decisions. Integrated into conventional feedback loops, they substantially improve response speed and robustness across diverse operating conditions. At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ML feedback enabled the first preemptive pointing stabilization at the BELLA Petawatt beamline, achieving a ~60% reduction in jitter and reduced response time in a coherent beam combining system by nearly an order of magnitude. These results show that ML can increase speed, stability, and adaptability without compromising determinism, opening new opportunities for intelligent control in next-generation facilities.",

These FFA arcs will use permanent magnets in a Halbach configuration to shape their fields. The design involves new optics for the linacs and remaining electromagnetic arcs, as well as new electromagnetic separators. These feed into the permanent magnet FFA arcs.

These correlations, absent in conventional binary-collision models, arise from the periodic betatron motion of particles within the beam. To enable direct verification of the theoretical calculations, we perform simulations in a computer code specifically written for that purpose. In the code, the particle distribution is preserved over time, ensuring conditions compatible with theoretical assumptions, and the IBS is neatly separated from the conventional Space Charge (SC) effect. The simulations, benchmarked against an exactly solvable case of an infinite isotropic uniform plasma, show good agreement with both uncorrelated models, such as Piwinski’s, and the new correlation-based theory, across various bunch distributions and dynamical regimes. This validates the simulation approach and highlights the role of time-correlated fields in accurate IBS modeling.",

The LCLS-II photoinjector has demonstrated a low-emittance (half-micron) beam operating at a high rate. During the injector operation, we have also encountered several challenges, such as e-beam splitting and large dark current from the gun. The split e-beam compromises FEL lasing, while the large gun dark current generates substantial amounts of ions, which backbombard and damage the photocathode, as well as cause beam loss downstream, frequently damaging components. Recently, these problems have been successfully addressed. On one hand, a relatively larger laser size was implemented on the photocathode, which helped suppress space charge effects, resulting in the disappearance of the split beam. On the other hand, an over-inserted photocathode, recently installed on the LCLS-II gun, has reduced the gun's dark current by a factor of 1000. The gun dark current reduction has significantly extended the photocathode's operational lifetime, eliminated the QE and FEL intensity dependence on beam rate, and substantially reduced beam loss downstream. This paper presents detailed analyses and solutions for LCLS-II photoinjector operational challenges.",

While five appropriately configured quadrupole magnets can implement such negative drifts, this approach is limited by spatial and experimental constraints. In this study, we investigate an alternative configuration that uses three quadrupole magnets to form a negative identity transport section between the TDCs instead of a negative drift. To assess the robustness of this proposed design, a computational study has been conducted on initial beam conditions to determine the operational limitations.

This data-efficient approach leverages Gaussian process regression and acquisition functions to navigate the high-dimensional design space with significantly fewer simulations than conventional methods. We compare the results of MOBO with those obtained from the well-established Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), highlighting differences in convergence speed, solution diversity, and computational efficiency.

Positioning the NLKs near the injection point reduces beam perturbation, while their on-axis zero field and gradient enable transparent injection—suppressing orbit and beam-shape oscillations during top-off operations. Particle-tracking simulations were performed using Accelerator Toolbox (AT), alongside the development of automated tools for converting magnetic field maps into AT-compatible kick maps, inserting NLKs at arbitrary lattice locations, conducting tracking, and optimizing NLK configurations. A key challenge is to shift the off-axis magnetic field peak closer to the beam orbit. Our novel NLK design achieves a peak within 5 mm of the axis—a significant improvement over the conventional greater than 7 mm range. Simulations accounting for realistic alignment and magnetic field errors indicate that a relaxed 5 mm DA and injection efficiency > 90% could be feasible for the NSLS-II upgrade lattice.",

Despite their role in daily operations, inspecting hundreds of water pumps is labor-intensive and performed only occasionally. Their unexpected failures can potentially lead to degradation of beam quality, hardware damage, and costly unplanned downtime**. This study introduces an innovative method for real-time monitoring of water pump vibrations to identify anomalies that signal potential mechanical failures. Our approach integrates (i) low-cost vibration sensors, which will consistently sample pump vibration data and transmit it to a (ii) Deep Autoencoder*** model for detecting anomalies. The autoencoder model recognizes each pump's normal pump vibration patterns and identifies subtle deviations. This monitoring framework can facilitate proactive maintenance by enabling early detection of anomalies, enhancing pump reliability, lowering maintenance expenses, and minimizing costly downtimes.",

Immediately downstream of each RF cavity, there is an electrostatic potential depression (EPD) section. An EPD section in an electrically insulated beam pipe biased with a negative high voltage. The EPD method remarkably shortens the buncher structure by rapidly forming the bunch train.

The polarity of the magnets is configured to form an alternating on-axis magnetic field orientation for minimizing the total weight.

A Nb₃Sn coating technique has been developed for Nb SRF cavities using co-sputtering of Nb-Sn composite target in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system. The composite target configuration and discharge conditions for co-sputtering were optimized to deposit Nb-Sn films on flat Nb substrates, followed by annealing to form Nb₃Sn. Multiple strategies have been explored to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb₃Sn coating, including optimizing a two-step annealing process, annealing in Sn vapor, and a light Sn recoating process. A 1.5 µm Nb-Sn co-sputtered film was deposited on the interior of a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity and annealed at 600 °C for 6 h, followed by 950 °C for 1 h. Cryogenic RF testing of the annealed cavity demonstrated a Tc of 17.8 K, confirming the formation of Nb₃Sn. Then, the annealed cavity underwent a light recoating treatment and attained a quality factor (Q0) of 8.5E+08 at 2.0 K.",

We proposed to demonstrate fabrication of a special shape field emitter array to produce a sheet electron beam for high frequency vacuum tubes. At Los Alamos, we established a Field Emitter Array Test Stand (FEATS) where we can apply voltages up to 40 kV to test field emitter arrays in a vacuum level of 10^-7 Torr or lower. At this test stand, we can take beam images, measure beam current and study beam divergence.

Recent experimental evidence shows that this limitation can be mitigated by reducing the RF pulse length to a few nanoseconds. One key challenge in designing an accelerator operating in the short-pulse regime is achieving the required short filling time. In this work, we designed a novel waveguide power splitter to independently feed an array of accelerating cells. A prototype X-band waveguide array for a one-to-four power splitter has been developed to drive standing-wave cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. The power is designed to be equally split and fed into four cavities, with the desired phase advance per cavity. A 3D-printed prototype has been used for low-power microwave measurements (\"cold\" tests). The results, including measurements with a vector network analyzer and time-domain measurements, show good agreement with simulations. Ongoing work includes designing a multi-cell accelerator based on this concept for two-beam acceleration with few-nanosecond RF pulses.",

Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) will be used in combined configuration. To maintain existing operational capabilities with these GaN amplifiers, the low-level control system needs to be modified for maximum transistor lifetime. The HEMT operates in a saturated condition, with a constant amplitude drive signal to avoid the high-power dissipation of linear operation with reduced drive. This leaves the phase of the RF inputs as a control mechanism, utilizing outphasing for amplitude modulation of the multistage amplifier. The GaN amplifiers also require a bias sequencing/protection board that is being designed and tested separately. To test and verify the control system, a low power test rack using commercial wideband RF components was built. This model system includes drive control, four 10 W amplifier stages, a final combination chassis, and accelerator timing system. The information from this test rack will be used to learn how to efficiently control a multistage high-power GaN amplifier to fit the requirements of the LANSCE linear accelerator.",

          "title": "Design of an optical amplifier for amplified OSC in IOTA facility at Fermilab729Optical stochastic cooling (OSC) is a cutting-edge beam cooling technology to reduce, control the 3 dimensional spread and the motion of particle beams. It has recently been successfully, experimentally, demonstrated in Fermilab's IOTA storage ring, marking a major step forward in beam cooling. OSC has the potential to significantly improve both the performance and flexibility as a beam cooling system. One promising way to boost OSC performance is by adding a high-gain optical amplifier. However, this amplifier must be carefully designed to meet the specific constraints of the OSC system. A major challenge lies in the limited optical delay, which is just 6 mm for the case of IOTA, set by the beam bypass, restricts us to use a short-length gain medium. This, along with IOTA’s high repetition rate and the relatively long duration of the optical pulses, limits the peak power available for the pump laser without damaging the crystal, which is crucial for achieving strong nonlinear gain. Additionally, it's essential to preserve the phase coherence of the undulator radiation during amplification, which further complicates the amplifier design. This report details a specialized amplifier setup that addresses these challenges, includes simulations of the integrated system, and summarizes the latest experimental progress and results.",

The hermetic assembly consists of a 2-cell 915 MHz SRF cavity, a coaxial fundamental power coupler and warm-to-cold transition beam tubes. The two-part shipping assembly consists of an inner frame, providing direct mounting of the components, and an outer frame mounted to the ground transport vehicle. The inner frame is then connected to the outer frame by way of wire-rope isolators. Accelerometer data from ground transportation of previous projects at Jefferson Lab provides the baseline for the expected frequency and magnitude of vibrational and shock events during transit. Modal analyses were carried out in ANSYS on the inner frame assembly and critical components to identify an appropriate wire-rope isolator configuration such that peak loads are mitigated and the incurred frequencies do not correspond with the fundamental modes of the structures.",

The first stage of the bunching system is a multi-harmonic buncher that operates at 12.125 MHz and creates a bunch train with a period of 82.5 ns at ~70% bunching efficiency. The remaining unbunched beam must be removed to avoid the production of undesirable ‘satellite’ bunches, which can quench the superconducting solenoids downstream during operation. In this paper, we present the design of a resonant sine-wave RF-structure that effectively removes the bunch ‘tails’ using a vertically deflecting kick.

This new lattice uses PMQs that provide both bending (dipole) and strong focusing (quadrupole) magnetic field on the electron beam. The permanent magnet (PM) technology is suitable for the high magnetic field strengths (0.5 T, 130 T/m) required for such combine function magnets. PM technology leads to a compact magnet design that is essential in realizing the complex bend lattice concept, as well as a passive magnet solution which does not require electrical power supply reducing power consumption by ~ 80% (from 1.7 MW to 0.3 MW for NSLS-II). Two PMQs magnets designs are under consideration: A hybrid design that use both PM and soft iron poles, and Halbach type that is a pure PM design. Both PMQs designs present challenges in achieving the specified magnetic field quality due to their higher sensitivity to errors (mechanical tolerances and PM properties).

          "title": "Heavy Ion implantation analysis in graphite for the FRIB charge selector769An advanced charge selector is currently under development at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) to intercept unwanted charge states of stripped heavy ion beams. Rotating graphite wheels are employed to absorb beams with a power up to 5 kW and a size as small as an rms width of 0.7 mm × 1.25 mm. The implantation of beam ions and accumulated radiation damage affect the material properties, potentially leading to its structural failure. Determining the foreign ion accumulation behavior is one critical aspect for predicting the operational lifetime of the graphite wheels. In this study, ion implantation distribution was first characterized using SRIM simulations, then coupled with Monte Carlo analysis to account for wheel geometry and rotational dynamics. The evolution of the ion concentration profiles was subsequently determined considering the diffusion effects. The analysis reveals that strategic beam positioning optimization, combined with diffusion effects, substantially reduces peak ion concentrations and implantation rates, providing essential data for graphite wheel lifetime assessment.",

Samples were synthesized at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and transferred under ultra-high vacuum to Arizona State University (ASU) for measurement using a photoemission electron microscope (PEEM). The maximum QE was measured to be 3.37 &amptimes 10&LTsup>-4</sup> at 230 nm, and the minimum MTE was 55.8 meV at 250 nm. These findings represent the first reported QE and MTE measurements of Cd&LTsub>3</sub>As&LTsub>2</sub> and are an important step in evaluating the viability of 3D DSMs as low-MTE photocathodes. Such photocathodes, constrained to lower MTEs by the electronic band structure, may prove effective in advancing beam brightness in next-generation instruments and techniques.",

Structure-based wakefield accelerator (SWFA) technology provides a viable approach to implementing beam-driven wakefield acceleration. An experiment at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) will utilize dielectric-lined structures to explore multi-beam excitation of wakefields for wakefield-pulse shortening and mapping of the transverse wakefield topology. These structures were commercially sourced and require a thin metallic film deposited on their outer surface. The first part of this paper summarizes the preparation of these structures. In parallel, a two-bunch beam configuration is required to support the experimental investigation, where one bunch excites the wakefield and the second serves as a loading or probe bunch. The experimental generation and testing of this two-bunch scheme at AWA are presented in this work.",

These materials can exhibit negative electron affinity at the surface, utilizing intrinsic polarization fields to engineer the band structure without the need for additional surface treatments. In this study, we investigate the effects of light exposure on the surface of III-nitride photocathodes and the resulting changes in QE and photoemission, using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) for characterization. We demonstrate that exposing a GaN photocathode to a 240 nm wavelength laser at 870 µW for 15 minutes increases the QE by two orders of magnitude, with a maximum QE of 2.34 × 10⁻⁴ observed.

During the APS-U commissioning, a 1Hz harmonic was detected in the beam motion. This harmonic originates from the 480V AC grid, caused by the booster ramping power supply operating at 1 Hz. The resulting grid disturbance introduced low-frequency ripples into both the corrector magnet power supplies and the L-Bend M1/M2 supplies, leading to the observed 1 Hz beam motion. This paper proposes two methods to mitigate these ripples in the corrector supplies: setpoint compensation using repetitive control, and regulation circuit adjustments through a simple jumper reconfiguration. The second approach was adopted and applied to all slow corrector magnet power supplies. Operational data showed that the low-frequency ripples were significantly attenuated in the corrector supplies, and in combination with fine-tuning of the L-Bend M1/M2 supplies, the 1 Hz beam motion was successfully eliminated.",

This study investigates the adiabatic transformation of transverse magnetic (TM) modes in a cylindrical cavity into transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes of a coaxial cavity by gradually introducing an inner conductor. Using CST Studio Suite, we simulate the eigenmode evolution as the geometry transforms from a pure cylindrical to a coaxial configuration. We track the behavior of TM010 through TM014 modes to observe the continuous evolution into the corresponding TEM0 through TEM4 modes of the coaxial cavity. The process is governed by the evolution of the electric field orientation as the geometry shifts, enabling the axial TM fields to reorient into the radial electric field configuration of TEM modes. Field patterns, eigen-frequencies, and mode indentities are analyzed throughtout the transition. The results provide simulation-based evidence that TM to TEM conversion occurs without generation of newer eigenmodes, offering a valuable insight into the design of transition regions in superconducting RF (SRF) systems and provides a foundation for experimental validation.",

Previous studies demonstrated promising 4D emittance performance of an EEX-based injector, but the beam’s longitudinal emittance at the linac exit still limits the final transverse emittance downstream of the EEX stage. We performed a comprehensive scan of injector parameters—including gun phase, laser spot size and pulse length, and solenoid strengths—to (1) estimate the minimum achievable longitudinal emittance, (2) identify sources of emittance growth, and (3) explore mitigation strategies.

These results motivate further investigation into the breakdown physics underlying the short-pulse acceleration regime. In this work, we present analytical models and numerical simulations of dark current dynamics in X-band cavities driven by short RF pulses. These studies explore key phenomena associated with RF breakdown across various time scales, including field emission, secondary electron emission, and plasma formation, with particular focus on their dependence on RF pulse length. Building on these insights, we describe the design and experimental plan for a single-cell X-band RF cavity operating at 11.7 GHz, optimized for high-gradient operation with 6~ns long RF pulses and integrated with RF breakdown diagnostics. This work aims to deepen the understanding of RF breakdown physics in the short-pulse regime and support the development of compact linear accelerators for future applications.",

We sputter-coated Nb₃Sn inside Nb SRF cavity using a stoichiometric Nb₃Sn tube target in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputter coater. The target was fabricated by growing an estimated >20 μm thick Nb₃Sn layer on a Nb tube via Sn vapor diffusion using Jefferson Lab’s coating system. Approximately 150 nm thick Nb-Sn films were sputter-deposited onto flat Nb samples at positions representing the beam tubes and equator of a 2.6 GHz Nb cavity. Post-deposition annealing at 950 °C for 3 h resulted in the formation of Nb₃Sn. Microstructural analysis of the annealed films was carried out to investigate the morphology and structure of the Nb₃Sn films. Later, a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity was coated with a ~1.2 μm thick sputtered Nb-Sn film using a stoichiometric Nb₃Sn target, followed by annealing. Cryogenic RF testing of the annealed cavity demonstrated a Tc of 17.8 K, indicating the formation of Nb₃Sn.

Modulated anode tubes such as the 1.25 MW LANSCE klystrons need high volt-age testing and processing prior to full operation. This not only verifies the klystron can hold-of HV but also allows the klystron to process out some internal imperfections prior to being pulsed by the modulator for the accelerator. The LANSCE accelerator is a relatively long pulse machine, and improper processing can lead to premature degradation in the performance of the tube. This paper describes recent improvements to the 1.25MW 805MHz klystron HV check and conditioning process through the development of a new high-potting test stand. High-potting setup and techniques that were historically used are contrasted with the new implementation. Our goal is to improve LANSCE operations by accelerating the high-potting process and reducing expert time and dependence. The new test stand will optimize legacy processes by improving diagnostics, automating control and reducing inconsistencies and process invariability due to human factors. Analysis and automation efforts for this critical process are discussed along with current benefits and future work.",

For these kinds of studies, the positrons must have low emittance and relatively high brightness. Unfortunately, fast positron sources like radioactive capsules or linac driven sources have broad energy and angular spread, which make them difficult to capture and use. Moderators are materials that produce slow, mono-energetic positrons from a fast positron beam. Since their efficiencies are typically less than $10^{-3}$ slow $e^+$ per fast $e^+$, research into how to maximize efficiency is of great interest. Previous work has shown that using a linac, one can decelerate the fast positron beam in order to greatly increase moderation efficiency. We present here start-to-end simulations using G4beamline to model a 100~MeV electron beam incident upon a Tungsten target, focused by an adiabatic matching device, and decelerated by a 1.3~GHz, 5-cell pillbox cavity. We show that by decelerating the positrons after their creation we can increase the number of positrons under 500~keV by 15 times, translating to a 16.3 times improvement in moderation efficiency, and therefore leading to a brighter positron source.",

This device has an output of 1.6 million volts DC. A converter is needed to transform this potential energy into useful electrical power. To achieve this the \"Pulsed Ion Reflex Klystron\" has been developed. The PIRK aims to achieve high conversion efficiencies by directing negatively charged ions through a re-entrant resonant cavity hundreds of times to gradually transfer energy from the moving particles to said cavity. Ions will be released into a 6-meter linear accelerator with roughly 1000 precisely spaced electrodes forming a quasi-parabolic potential. This potential is symmetric about the midpoint of the tube causing ions to oscillate with a frequency of approximately 1 MHz independent of energy. Perturbations to this parabolic potential are designed to provide radial electrostatic beam focusing. An algorithm is devised to produce optimal voltage curves to maximize both longitudinal bunching and radial confinement, and these curves are examined against practically realizable potentials. Energy is coupled out of the resonant cavity using a loop antenna connected to a silicon carbide rectifying diode. This converts the RF in the cavity to a 400V intermediate DC bus that can easily be inverted to wall power.",

These mechanical vibrations were found to produce a beam orbit jitter that was detrimental to the collider luminosity. During RHIC operation, this has been effectively mitigated by the implementation of a fast feedback orbit control system. For the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) Hadron Storage Ring (HSR), the RHIC triplet package will be modified, magnets will be removed, and the cryogenic lines will be rearranged inside the cryostat. A comprehensive analysis of the RHIC triplet vibration has been undertaken to ensure that the planned triplet piping modifications would not increase the current triplet magnet vibrations and overwhelm the existing fast feedback control system.

          "title": "Upgraded photoinjector laser pulse train generator at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator888The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility operates a high-charge (100s of nC) electron beam in a bunch train, with eight electron bunches at a 769 ps spacing matching the linac operating frequency of 1.3 GHz. AWA’s electron beam is optimized for producing large wakefields in resonant structures to study structure wakefield acceleration. This is achieved by maximizing total beam charge, and by correct bunch train timing to enhance the wakefield via inter-bunch coherence. The properties of the bunch train are determined by a “multisplitter” in the photoinjector laser system, in which a series of beamsplitters splits one laser source into eight - ideally equal - pulses. However, AWA’s previous system did not split pulses evenly, with up to a 2:1 ratio between pulse energies within a train. Damaging electrical breakdown events within the electron gun, driven by high single bunch charge, occurred at lower total charge in this non-uniform set-up, limiting maximum charge. Thus, a new multisplitter using polarizing beamsplitters and half-wave plates (HWPs) was implemented. Unlike the previous fixed-ratio beam-splitter design, the new system enables tuning the splitting ratio for each beamsplitter, resulting in a more uniform pulse train. Large 2” optics and uncoated HWPs are also used to increase the laser intensity damage threshold (LIDT). This paper presents the design, characterization and lessons learned in early commissioning of AWA's upgraded laser pulse train generator.",

          "title": "Booster cavity damper redesign for PIP-II891A new Higher Order Mode (HOM) damper was designed and is undergoing testing for the Booster accelerator cavity at Fermilab. In anticipation of the PIP-II upgrade, it was discovered that the higher intensity of PIP-II may cause beam instability due to an excited mode at 106 MHz. This unfortunately corresponds with the cavity’s 2nd order harmonic mode, which will sweep from 86-105.7 MHz. The new damper is a modification of an existing damper that was designed to reduce an existing static HOM at 83 MHz, with the new design intending to cover the 2nd order HOM as well. The existing damper uses an inductive coupling loop to extract RF energy from the cavity which then goes through a filter in order to reflect the fundamental frequency back into the cavity while passing HOMs to a dump load. The new damper intends to replace the filter portion of the system with a wider band variant while also changing the topology from a coaxial cable loop filter to a componentized PCB-based design. Primary design challenges include bandwidth coverage, impedance matching of the various modes, long term thermal and mechanical stability, radiation hardness, and high voltage handling. Initial designs achieved the desired damping but were found to quickly succumb to destructive arcing due to the voltages present. More finalized designs intend to address this problem through circuit design modifications as well as the use of hardier components.",

The Bayesian framework is particularly well-suited for this challenge, offering sample-efficient optimization, principled incorporation of prior knowledge, and uncertainty-aware inference. In particular, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has proven to be an efficient and general approach for the non-sequential, static nature of beam-tuning tasks. To further accelerate convergence, Prior-Mean-Assisted Bayesian Optimization (pmBO) was developed, enabling rapid adaptation from prior belief to real-time machine conditions with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, a virtual diagnostic for the beam’s transverse quadrupolar moment (BPM-Q) has been developed to provide non-invasive, fast measurements of beam envelope information. To optimize the reconstruction of Courant-Snyder parameters from BPM-Q data, Bayesian Active Learning (BAL), employing a differentiable beam envelope simulator as a surrogate model, has been implemented. Together, these developments illustrate the power of Bayesian methods in achieving faster, more accurate beam-tuning.",

To accelerate DUNE’s physics reach and ensure robust beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. At its core is a Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor using a physics-informed Digital Twin. By reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be reduced from 5% to 1%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US–Japan R&D effort will deploy a LAPPD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. ToF measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects. Simulations confirm strong response to these effects. ML models predict beam quality and horn current to sub-percent accuracy from muon data, enhancing anomaly detection and stability. This scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity, reduces systematics, and sets a new standard for high-power accelerator operations.",

So far, simulations are not good enough to predict loss patterns. Thus, an extensive Booster tune up will be necessary to achieve required performance. In this paper we present an effort to build a data-driven loss model using Bayesian techniques, and subsequently to rebalance losses for higher trip margins. We first created several sets of spatially and temporally isolated orbit and optics knobs, and trained Gaussian process models for each beam loss monitor as well as beam current. Novel techniques of uncertainty constraints and approximate GP fitting were introduced to handle safety and timing requirements. We then performed single and multi-objective tuning using scalarized objectives comprised of critical beam loss locations. We achieved significant rebalancing of losses, increasing margins by 25%, as well as an overall improvement in transmission efficiency of 0.4%. Automated data collection is being developed so that more accurate surrogate models can be trained over time.",

However, the exact mechanisms by which these treatments improve cavity performance remain largely unknown. This work provides new insights into the role of nitrogen and oxygen in SRF cavity performance by using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to precisely quantify the concentrations and depth profiles of these impurities within niobium cutouts. We correlate these impurity profiles with detailed cavity performance measurements, including surface resistance and quality factor, and compare our findings with predictions from BCS theory. The results demonstrate that while both nitrogen and oxygen enhance performance, ten times more oxygen is required to achieve the same reduction in BCS resistance as interstitial nitrogen. We present a potential model in which the observed variation arises from nitrogen's greater effectiveness in trapping hydrogen, thus reducing the formation of niobium hydrides and enhancing superconducting gap.",

In most existing beam delivery systems, two separate magnets are used to scan the beam in the transverse planes. To enable more compact systems and gantries, a combined function 2D scanner magnet with a short working distance is highly desirable. Earlier designs suffer from field non-uniformity in at least one plane. A compact 2D scanner magnet has been designed to produce high-field uniformity in both planes. The scanner was designed for carbon ions and could be easily scaled down for protons and other light ions. The design is based on saddle coils where the coils of the two magnets are interleaved to balance both field properties and power losses when scanning in both planes. The simulated field performance shows ~ 0.1% field uniformity in both planes within the useful aperture of the magnet . This represents a significant improvement over the prior art of the elephant-ear scanner design. Different design options and possible implementations will be presented.",

Therefore, low mean transverse energy (MTE), high quantum efficiency (QE) along with long operational lifetime and robustness under high electric fields and laser fluences must be demonstrated by the photocathode for these bright beam applications. Recent investigations have revealed that the epitaxial growth of single crystal cesium antimonides can be achieved by photocathode growth on lattice matched substrates. In this letter, the experimental setup for highly promising alkali antimonide photocathode growth by molecular beam epitaxy on lattice matched substrates and in-situ characterization with reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) has been presented. To adapt the L-band RF gun of Argonne Cathode Test-stand (ACT) for extensive testing of alkali antimonides in real accelerator conditions, compatible cathode plug design and smooth transportation process have been developed and also described in this paper.",

In the superradiant regime, the pulse simultaneously compresses and amplifies as it propagates through the FEL, making superradiance very promising for pushing the performance limits of attosecond x-ray FELs. To date, this regime has been studied in asymptotic limits, but there is no model for how the initially linear dynamics of the seeded FEL transition into the nonlinear superradiant behavior. We derive an analytical model for the 1D FEL seeded by a short pulse which accurately captures the linear dynamics, the nonlinear superradiant evolution, and the smooth transition between them. Our model fills a critical gap in our understanding of FEL superradiance and nonlinear time-dependent FEL physics more broadly, and may provide a bridge to the corresponding problem in three-dimensions, and analogous problems in other fields exhibiting soliton behavior.",

Therefore, according to the rocket equation, the weighted average exhaust velocity needs to be over 1% of the speed of light for reasonable ratios of dry mass to fuel mass. The fusion reactor architecture presented herein consists of an electrostatic charged particle trap that brings two ion beams into collision with equal and opposite momentum. The two fusion channels under consideration for interstellar missions are p/Li7 and He3/He3, utilizing an array of low mass electrodes that minimize interactions with fusion daughters escaping from the collision point and focused to generate thrust. A prototype colliding beam accelerator has been built to determine the viability of achieving collider luminosities commensurate with the requirements of this application. A novel architecture overcomes past Coulomb scattering limitations. Reactor and propulsion system design parameters are presented in this paper along with preliminary prototype operational results with deuterium collisions.",

To demonstrate feasibility, a CB prototype was developed and tested using the NSLS-II linac beamline, scaling the beam energy to 100–200 MeV while maintaining strong focusing. The prototype utilized a 16-wedge symmetric Halbach permanent magnet design, achieving a gradient of 140 T/m within ultra-compact quadrupoles. The CB beamline was installed and commissioned in two phases, first as a strong periodic focusing element and later as a combined bending and focusing system. The beam commissioning results showed good agreement with theoretical models, confirming that the Complex Bend functions effectively as both a strong focusing and bending element by offsetting CB poles.

The specific feature of the LANSCE accelerator is the simultaneous delivery of beams with multiple beam flavors to several targets. Acceleration of various beams in a single RFQ provides less flexibility for optimal adjustment of acceleration and focusing parameters concerning the existing LANSCE setup caused by differences in beam current, charge per bunch, and beam emittances. An important issue in the low-energy beam transport of the proposed injector is the different levels of space charge neutralization of the multi-component beam. Coupling between degrees of freedom in the presence of strong space charge forces of the beams results in unavoidable beam mismatch in the Front End and requires careful six-dimensional matching of beams with accelerator structures. The paper discusses key issues in the planned Front End and suggests ways to mitigate them.",

          "title": "Development of sodium potassium antimonide photocathodes for use of coherent electron cooling997The Coherent Electron Cooling (CeC) technique is a breakthrough in accelerator science, enhancing ion beam brightness in facilities like the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)*. The success of CeC relies on high-performance photocathodes (PCs) for photoinjectors, where ideal PCs exhibit high QE, low emittance, long lifetimes, and minimal dark current. Alkali antimonide PCs meet these requirements. Among these, Na-K-Sb shows enhanced robustness, particularly under high-temperature conditions from high-power laser illumination, which generates high current electron beams. It also demonstrates improved vacuum stability and long-term QE consistency compared to other alkali antimonides like K2CsSb and Cs3Sb. These attributes make Na-K-Sb an effective choice for applications requiring both thermal and vacuum stability. This work presents the growth of Na-K-Sb PCs using the CeC cathode deposition system**, alongside detailed QE measurements and spatially resolved QE maps. These findings highlight the potential of Na-K-Sb PCs to advance CeC performance significantly and foster the development of high current, high-brightness electron sources for broader applications",

          "title": "Development of superconducting adaptive gap undulator (SC-AGU)1000The concept of the AGU has been proposed for some time*. However, utilizing a permanent magnet-based device complicates the design due to the necessity of independent gap control for each segment and, in the case of an in-vacuum undulator, the requirement for a flexible continuity sheet to mitigate image current heating. The adoption of SC magnets eliminates these concerns. The SC-AGU prototype will comprise three sections of magnetic arrays with a total length of 120 cm, with the central section featuring a smaller gap than the end units. To achieve this, a UHV chamber will be designed for eventual fabrication, incorporating a non-uniform aperture that conforms to the beam envelope. Furthermore, to maintain a constant fundamental photon energy and maximize on-axis spontaneous emission, each SC section will be engineered with distinct period lengths, with the central section possessing a shorter period than the end units. This paper presents the methodology for end-field analysis, encompassing detailed simulations to characterize the magnetic field distribution at the extremities of each magnetic array. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of field quality at junctions and its influence on radiation properties, ensuring the optimization of on-axis spontaneous emission while preserving the electron beam’s ‘stay-clear’ area and mitigating impedance constraints imposed by the undulator magnet structure.",

End-to-end differentiability enables gradient-based optimization across 500+ parameters simultaneously—previously impossible with conventional tools—while the model incorporates static/dynamic errors and serves as a virtual commissioning platform for diverse hardware integration. The framework facilitates reinforcement learning for pulsed/CW mode transitions, predictive maintenance through anomaly detection, and autonomous tuning algorithm development with real-time execution capability. Validation against physics simulations shows excellent agreement for the front-end, with initial results demonstrating potential for 30% commissioning time reduction and proactive fault mitigation, providing a scalable blueprint for operating next-generation high-intensity accelerators.",

We aim to experimentally study this compression scheme at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which boasts a world-leading proton bunch intensity. The primary goal of these experiments is to benchmark simulations against turn-by-turn phase space measurements during the compression.

Investigating fundamental physics phenomena, such as the electric dipole moment (EDM) of protons, demands highly precise experimental setups. In such precision experiments, intra-beam scattering (IBS) causes emittance growth, which degrades beam quality and limits the spin coherence time (SCT), a key parameter for sensitive EDM detection. The integration of a stochastic cooling system for stored polarized proton beams offers a potential solution by mitigating the effects of IBS, suppressing emittance growth, stabilizing beam dynamics, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the storage ring. This paper examines the feasibility of incorporating such a system into the proton EDM storage ring and evaluates its potential to preserve beam polarization and quality, both essential for advancing EDM experiment.",

In particular, space provides two environment challenges that provide exposure to energetic heavy ions: galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle events (SPEs). These particles cause risk by depositing charge in microelectronics potentially causing operational errors or even destructive failure. Testing electronics with a variety of ground-based accelerators is not new. What is new is the increasing need for high-energy (> 100 Mev/n) heavy ions with ~40% of all testing predicted to require this high energy by 2030. This is primarily for two reasons: - Mission-enabling advanced stacked microelectronics technologies such as 3D packaged devices that require higher energy to penetrate to the sensitive locations within these devices, and, - Increase in demand to perform system-level testing using “large irradiation area” kinematics. This large area also allows for large sample sizes to be irradiated simultaneously for efficiency. Presently, the is only one domestic accelerator that can achieve high energy heavy ions, that of Brookhaven National Laboratory’s NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. Here, we discuss the requirements needed by the test community and the domestic effort to close the gap in the number of test hours.

We plan to investigate resolving this challenge by combining recent advances in isochronous transport and induction cells. The recently commissioned SLS-2 upgrade uses an anti-bend arc cell to control dispersion and reduce emittance. We use this anti-bend design to yield an arc whose R56 can be adjustable to near-zero on a per-arc basis. This fine control of momentum compaction allows for better mitigation of effects that spoil the longitudinal phase space. A consequence of RF technology, which most ring-based light sources use, is that high average current can only be achieved by pushing peak current, as only 1-2% of the circumference actually stores current. High peak current drives other design considerations which result in a fast churning of the longitudinal phase space. A ring with low peak current to avoid this churning has an average current too low to make a useful SSMB light source. Induction cells with a reset time of ~10 ns have recently been developed for cinematographic radiography. An induction cell could allow over 95% of the ring to store current, yielding a high average current and low peak current. Here we outline an investigation to explore the beam dynamics and technology of such an isochronous induction cell storage ring.",

In Fermilab Linac, orbit responses were recorded by oscillating the corrector currents and cavity phases in a sinusoidal manner parasitically during regular operation, simultaneously oscillating up to 19 correctors and 7 cavities at distinct frequencies, providing faster, drift-resistant measurements through frequency-domain analysis. This report describes the technique, including error estimations and consistency checks and shows examples of the measurements.",

To accomplish this, the total charge injected from the linac into the existing Booster RCS ring will increase from 4.5 to 6.5E12 while the machine ramp rate will be raised from 15 to 20 Hz. The Booster accelerates beam from 800 to 8000 MeV and crosses transition at $\\gamma = 5.45$ In current, pre PIP-II operations, no formal gamma-t jump system is used and the longitudinal emittance blowup is limited with an active quadrupole mode feedback system. Due to the slip-stacking process used in the dowstream Recycler Ring to accumulate and increase bunch intensity, to prevent excessive particle loss the longitudinal emittance at extraction limited is set to 0.1 eV-s (95\\%). Given that collective fields scale with intensity, it is anticipated that additional measures will need to be put in place to meet this requirement. We look at the so-called triple phase-jump technique a possible candidates for transition mitigation and present some simulation results. Despite known limitations, attractive aspects of the triple jump are that the phase manipulations are incorporated within the digital LLRF system; no additional magnets or pulsed power supplies are needed and the technique is compatible with active quadrupole mode feedback.",

Resonant interactions between photons and atomic systems offer significantly enhanced resonant cross-sections, often several orders of magnitude greater than what is achievable through conventional Compton scattering of electron and photon beams. The Gamma Factory initiative at CERN aims to exploit this enhancement by employing ultra-relativistic, partially stripped ion beams to generate high-intensity gamma-ray beams. In this work, we first examine the energy-matching requirements for resonance. We then present a semi-classical model based on a damped-driven oscillator to describe resonant Compton scattering. This model provides physical insight into the resonant cross-section and the limitations imposed by beam-beam interactions. We also propose a framework for simulating the scattering process.",

One of these applications is the production of critical radionuclides. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the reserve beam power to produce radioisotope at SNS, a design concept of a small-scale experimental target station in the Linac Dump area has been developed. This experimental facility will provide isotope yield benchmarking data using protons in the GeV range. It will also enable additional research and development in isotope handling and radiochemical separation. The target station consists of a target module enclosed in a vessel and concrete shielding. Particle transport calculations and thermo-mechanical simulations are used to determine beam parameters, decay time, isotope yield, shielding dimensions, and target design parameters.

To evaluate technical challenges and study beam dynamics with complex bend, two bending magnets of existing NSLS-II bare lattice are proposed to be replaced with complex bends, introducing lattice asymmetry. To study the impact of asymmetry on NSLS-II bare lattice, an asymmetric lattice is developed by adjusting quadrupole triplets in the Cell 8 long straight section. This paper presents the modified linear optics, optimization of nonlinear dynamics, and a comparison with the nominal bare lattice. The optimized asymmetric bare lattice is also experimentally measured in the machine, and dynamic aperture measurements are reported.",

This report presents estimations on implementation of such a procedure at PIP-II H- linac being constructed at Fermilab. In part, the case when the flight time between BPMs is larger than the period of BPM frequency is considered in detail. When the absolute BPM phase calibration is not available, the BPM phase information can be used to trace deviations of the beam energy from the desired value. Such “energy deviation” parameter is operationally implemented at the transfer line between 400 MeV Linac and the Booster, and its analog is expected to be used in the transfer line from PIP-II as well.",

The septum magnet at the PSR is used for extracting the accumulated 800-MeV proton beams for transport to the target stations. The existing septum magnet uses parallel, planar coils creating a uniform deflecting magnetic field. However, one coil plate co-locates with the septum; this placement results in the coil, witnessing intense radiation dose rates, receiving accumulated damage to the epoxy potting during the PSR operation. The redesigned septum magnet uses a ferritic steel septum, and the coils are positioned farther away from the proton beam pipes. This placement, combined with the adoption of a more radiation-resistant potting epoxy, is expected to reduce the dose rate on the coil pack, correspondingly increasing the operating lifetimes. The magnet pole tips are refined with shim features to provide a wide flat-field region. The mechanical engineering of the yoke components and the supporting structures is underway. Particle tracking simulations of the proton beam deflection in the septum magnet were performed, and the comparison of performance between the existing and the redesigned septum magnets is reported.",
